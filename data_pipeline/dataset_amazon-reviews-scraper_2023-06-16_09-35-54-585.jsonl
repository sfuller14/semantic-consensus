One is the sound card. I listen to Spotify and KNOW how my songs sound , and this computer does not play them correctly. Also when you switch from speakers to earbuds (which you have to go to the back of the screen to do) you then have to tell the computer that your now using earphones or there will be no sound at all. And that is also a pain bc if you miss the pop up window as you run back to look at the screen, I couldn't find how to switch over, so I have to unplug and plug in again so the pop up happens and I can tell it which one I'm using!!!!! If it sounds like a pain believe me it is. And then the sound isn't even good. It plays youtube vids fine and every other thing with sound just not Spotify. I actually listen to my music on my laptop still to avoid all this hullabaloo. Also no disk drive is a bit weird. There are light areas around the screen when its on but black. Sometimes I can see it when a movie has a really dark scene but for the most part this is a small issue. Still, I feel something was damaged in delivery or storage. But so far so good as far as anything else. Just that all the plugs are in the back which makes any change more of a pain than if they were along the side. I got it on sale so now $890 seems like a bit much for these issues but if your looking to save $100-$150 (which you'll need to spend on a disk drive if you don't have one) go for it! Also the keyboard and mouse work just fine for me. No issues yet.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "processor_description: i5-1235UStyle: Desktop only", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

It amazes me how far computer technology has advanced since I first purchased the Apple II with only 48k of ram and the size of a large electric typewriter back in the early 80‚Äôs. When I first saw how fast the Mac mini performed I thought it may look mini but it has major power on the inside.Now for my complaint with Amazon. In the description for the Mac mini it said New Mac Mini... it is only at the end of the description does it say renewed. I think a more accurate description would be ‚ÄúRenewed Mac mini...‚Äù When I initially saw this i  thought ‚ÄúWow, a new Mac mini for only $626! That‚Äôs $38 cheaper than Amazon‚Äôs regular price of $664. And it says there is only 1 left. I better hurry and purchase it before someone else does.‚Äù Okay, I have learned my lesson to read the full product description of the item before making a purchase decision.When my Mac mini arrived I opened the box only to find another sealed box on the inside. This box had a sticker that said in bold letters ‚ÄúNew Item‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúRenewed Item‚Äù Also there was another sticker that said ‚ÄúAmazon Warehouse Deals Inspected and Repackaged‚Äù When I saw these stickers I was confused because initially I thought I purchased a brand new Mac mini. After opening the second box there was the typical white Apple box shrink wrapped in clear plastic. I removed the shrink wrap and opened the box and there was the Mac mini wrapped in Apple‚Äôs white opaque product wrapping. I removed that wrapping and there was a blemish free Mac mini aluminum case along with the information and the Apple decal stuck in a white folder along with the power cord fastened with paper straps. After purchasing many Apple products over the years I thought no way is this a renewed product everything looks so perfect. It even has that brand new Apple smell to it. Next I decided to call Amazon. I explained to the representative that it appears I purchased a brand new Mac mini. The representative said ‚ÄúNo, it is renewed.‚Äù I then told the representative that I made a mistake in thinking I purchased a brand new Mac mini. The representative was kind enough to say I could return it. In spite of what the representative stated that it was a renewed item, and I was 99% positive it was brand new Mac mini.Now the good news. I decided to give Apple a call and spoke with a representative in the sales department. I explained the situation to the representative and asked them if I gave them the serial number on the Mac mini could they check to see if it was brand new or previously owned? The representative responded ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I gave the representative the serial number  and in less than a minute the representative replied it is a brand new Mac mini. I had the representative repeat the serial number back to me to make sure they looked up the correct one. The representative also explained that it was eligible for Apple Care which extends the standard 1 year warranty to 3 years.The representative offered to transfer me to Apple Care if I wanted to purchase the extended warranty. I told the representative to transfer me to Apple Care. The representative at Apple Care asked for the serial number and a screen shot of my invoice from Amazon. The representative told me that everything is fine and I purchased Apple Care using Apple pay for $99.I don‚Äôt know how or what happened. It‚Äôs rare for Amazon to make a mistake in the customer‚Äôs favor but in my case I guess the God of Luck was looking down upon me and thought ‚ÄúThis guy has already spent thousands of dollars as a Prime Member let‚Äôs give him a break.‚ÄùNow for a brief message to Mr. Bezos. I know this was a cut in your profit margin. But fear not! I will continue to spend thousands of more dollars for your products because I am an Amazon junkie.

Worked overtime and skipped my vacation so I could afford to get all x3 of my kids computers. 1st computer worked so I bought x2 more. Second computer nothing no output what so ever no bios nothing. Worked on it 4 hours put in a working graphics card I had, switched cords , inputs, adapters nothing. Had to be cpu or motherboard or both. Graphics card does have power and fans turn on. And third computer I got from them power supply sounds like it's about to blow !. So instead of just sending me replacement parts they want me to pack it up drive 30 min away 30 min back. Ship them computer back and probably won't get replacement computer back in time for Christmas!!!!! I bought desk, gaming chairs, headsets controllers and these guys not even gonna have the computers for my kids!!!!! Computer seem to be descent specs if built with working parts!!! Don't buy this garbage 1 out of 3 computers work and customer service and techs awful with customer help or satisfaction !!! Will change review if they straiten this out. Oh yeah bought extended warranty didn't expect to need it soon as I opened computer up !!!!!!!Update only gotten worse!!1.So far I have replaced power supply2. Had bad processor3.received broken mouse still don't have one.4. Hard drives were corrupt and wouldn't boot up operating system5.graphics card overheats6.comouter came not even assembled power wires,DVD drive USB nothing was even hooked to the board and they claim it was tested before shipping it ü§¶I'm running around in circles getting angry every day with customer service to resolve issues. Spent my holiday time fixing the garbage they sent me instead of spending time with my family. My daughter computer froze up twice within 4 hrs on Christmas. Had to tell her Santa must of fallen on ice n dropped computer and damaged it üò°. Amazon customer support is a joke as well canceling my prime membership. From now on only buying my electronics from Micro Center!! They have ruined my holiday, stressed me out beyond belief waiting for parts working on garbage after work and trying to watch x4 kids. They said they were gonna re inburse me for mouse now they say they won't. At first they said they would send replacement graphics card and when it got here I could swap out n send bad one back. Now I have to yank it n computer my daughter got for Christmas will be down until they send a new card. They have no word !! Iv had to drive multiple times 30 min there 30 min back to UPS cause they won't do porch pickup !! I'm wasting gas and time with these people. Didn't want to send whole computer back cause Santa brought them ü§¶. 1st computer I got was descent the other x2 complete garbage!!  So 1/3 odds I'd say of getting anything that even remotely boots up. Actually 1/4 cause I did send one back and they sent me another broken one before Christmas cause I opened early to test to try to make sure everything worked before Christmas. I was able to get graphics card usable using msi afterburner and turning clock settings all the way down. I wrote a lot but to save you and you children's holidays. And they have gotten me in trouble at work for taking longer on break talking to them to try to resolve only for them to keep asking same thing for 4 days in a row!!! A complete nightmare !!! Worked on it for hours drive all over will not buy electronics off Amazon ever again!!Update: going to be canceling amazon prime for letting people like this do business on here. 2 weeks after Christmas sent third defective computer back and still no refund or working computer. Absolutely the worst shopping experience I've ever had!! Ruined Christmas ruined new Year's funds tied up also negative impact on my daughters b day that was on Jan 6.

The Intel integrated graphics are alright as well believe it or not. In addition to her work, she plays some light games including The Sims 4 - which runs butter smooth. So I really can't complain about the unit at all. Except for one small detail. The front faceplate of the computer isn't seated properly and it is just a bit askew. This does not affect the ability of the little computer to do exactly as advertized and I can fix it myself.Now not only did I receive the computer and power supply itself ( which is all I ordered)  but in addition I as sent a very basic (read really bad) keyboard and mouse - but you have to remember I didn't order that and it was basically included in the price of the unit. I also received a display port to HDMI adapter that I didn't order as well which saved me the expense of going out to buy a display port cable. There was also a 3.5mm audio patch cable as well.I WILL be ordering another of these in the near future, rest assured.

MSI motherboard, MSI gpu, deep cool liquid cooler, Kingston fury ram, montech psu. It is all expertly built, excellent airflow and very securely fastened.Performance wise this thing is great. I use it only for gaming pretty much. It plays every game I‚Äôve thrown at it so far (doom eternal, RDR2, ESO, Elden ring, cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 so far) at all maxed settings 200+ fps no lag no dropped frames no overheating and basically no noise. The gpu temps haven‚Äôt gone much above 50 and the cpu temps not much above 55 during the most demanding games I‚Äôve played which is great.All in all I highly recommend not just this particular build but also the Skytech Gaming company itself. I called their tech support with a quick question and was amazed to be greeted by a man who spoke English as his first language! He was very helpful and answered my questions with zero troubles. He was also very friendly and we had a nice conversation to boot, very deserving of a 5 star rating!", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Pattern: DesktopStyle: 13600K | 4080", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hECPYNpFL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 2}

It never worked as it should for more than a matter of hours, and displayed a wide variety of problems (see below for a sample). The last straw was when I closed the Chrome browser and the whole screen went black. The mouse pointer was visible, but nothing else. There was nothing to click on, so I couldn't even shut it down. After a couple of hard reboots this problem persisted, so the machine is now on its way back to SJ Computers. No one is to blame -- there's just a ghost in this machine.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Bought the Dell i7-7050 SFF. It arrived in good shape two days early, but I didn't have the correct video cables (VGA to Display Port), so I didn't turn it on for a couple of days. Once I had the cables I fired it up, set up Windows and left it running for several hours, when it began to display various display anomalies: When I opened programs, the window would display for a second or two, then disappear. Later, the whole screen began flashing on and off. The Start button didn't work so I had to shut it down with the power switch.With the machine unusable, I called SJ Computers (the seller). This was on a Friday, and I spoke to two techs, Alex and Logan. Much troubleshooting was tried, and eventually the machine seemed to be stable and I was told to use it over the weekend and call back with a progress report on Sunday. I used it as much as I could, and it randomly logged itself off several times. When the \"disappearing window\" symptom reappeared on Sunday I thought I needed a replacement, and I called to ask for one.This time I spoke to Aaron, a third tech, who logged into the machine remotely to try and resolve the issues. He ran some diagnostic and repair tools, and in the end suggested a complete reinstall of Windows. Since I had not installed anything on the computer, I agreed to that. I now have a completely fresh installation of Windows that seems to be working, and I'm hoping all will be well over time.AARON WAS THOROUGH, COURTEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL DURING THIS LENGTHY PROCESS, and put my mind somewhat at ease by offering to extend the 90-day warranty for an extra thirty days. He went the extra mile by calling me back an hour or so after the Windows reset to make sure all was well. This computer will be used in mission-critical situations and I can't afford random shutdowns or on-screen controls that don't work. Since these problems were intermittent I can't honestly say that it's \"fixed,\" but I fully expect it to be.For the past couple of hours this computer has been working fine, but I will update this review if there are further problems with it.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 32G/1T SSD", "reviewImages": [], "position": 4}

I bought it for basic functions for running basic word documents, spreadsheets, and paying bills etc. and am pleased with it. Takes an extra second or two to open a second spreadsheet, but I am okay with that. However, this is advertised as WiFi and Bluetooth. These features are not internal but done with USB adapters. The WiFi adapter they sent me was VERY slow, when it worked at all, making the PC appear very bad. My router is about 20 feet from this computer and my work computer, TV's, and everything else works just fine on fiber optic internet. I connected an Ethernet cable straight into the PC and it is like a different machine, opening web pages very fast. Second, the Bluetooth adapter they sent would not transmit past my monitors 3 feet from the PC. I literally had to hold my headset behind the monitor to get it to connect and it would loose connection when I sat down. Total junk. I ordered a $12 Bluetooth adapter and I can go to the next room. Third, the power cable they sent me did not hold into the plug on the PC very well and if you moved the tower, it would loose connection and shutdown. I have multiple power cords and simply replaced it and the issue is solved.In conclusion, for the money the PC is great and does what I want it to but only after I made the upgrades to the accessories. If they would send a decent quality WiFi adapter and Bluetooth adapter I would have given it 5 stars. The plug I don't see as a regular issue, but unless they upgrade the adapters they send you, plan on ordering those for yourself.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 32G/1T SSD", "reviewImages": [], "position": 9}

So I came across the mac mini M1, refurbished. GREAT price and the new M1 chip were very attractive.So after buying the computer and trying to connect the bluetooth mouse and keyboard I noticed that there was THE LAG!!! (which I read so much about but read other people reporting that they were not having those issues). The lag was BAD!!!! So I researched and tried everything.... and I DID try everything, to the point of having to buy a corded mouse and after plugging it, there was some improvement but nothing compared to how a normal computer with a normal cursor would move. And I even tried the mouse (a cheap one from macally created for MACs) and it worked perfectly without any flaws. But in this one it keeps having some lag still. So if you're thinking either to buy this, the iMac 24 inch with M1 chip or waiting for a bigger iMac M1 chip and possible 27 inch, I suggest to go for any of the 2 latter but DONT BUY THE M1 MAC MINI. There are reports everywhere of the lag happening, improving to some extent for some people but not completely going away. And let me tell you, IT IS GOING TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY. So don't do the same mistake.UPDATE:Turns out that afte changing the monitor to a 1440p, 140 hz, 27 inch monitor (I got ViewSonic) the lag disappeared completely.

I'm not doing any heavy lifting, web browsing, 3D Printing software, DAC for audio and some 4X games. My first computer was a VIC-20 back in 1980 but this unit surpasses any computer I've built or purchased by a large margin. The MacOS is nice but I come from a Linux environment so in the end I'll probably install Parallels and run Linux. The M1 processor that Apple has created is truly a marvel. For video or audio editing on the cheap pickup the 16 GB RAM model with the 512 GB of storage and you will be a happy camper. For the normal computer user the base model with 8 GB is fine.

Everything is contained in the monitor, so no tower or extra wires all over the place. And it comes with a wireless keyboard & mouse to have less wires & clutter on your desk.I don't use the computer myself for day-to-day activities, but I did set it up for my dad & that was easy. The system booted up quickly, it asks you a few questions & pretty much sets itself up. Once I connected it to WiFi, the computer did all the necessary updates, accessed our Cloud, & downloaded all my dad's documents from his old computer to this new computer. I was really impressed with that, because usually, I have to do that manually or through an info share program. It really took me no time at all to get this computer ready for my dad.And this is a really sleek, nice looking computer too. I really like it & am a little jealous of my dad.

This fit the bill.  I wish I had thought out the purchase more before I bought i, though.  Nothing bad.......I just needed USB and memory adjustments.  Height check, too.I did add memory to it after purchase.  That 8GB is not enough IMHO.  Windows uses 6GB right off the bat!  If it had to use virtual memory (on the disk), then it would slow down big time.Memory upgrade was........interesting.  Watch a couple of youtube videos.  You can do it. Just go slow.4 USB slots is ok, but, wife wanted her special mouse, so, instead of sharing one slot with the KB and mouse, she was now using 2.  Then, I got a DVD drive, for she HAD to have it for a couple of programs.  Now, only have one left.  Yup, got a USB hub, and so all is ok.Screen is nice.  The whole setup is nice.My only knock on the unit is that the height is not adjustable.  I thought about cutting the desk, or the bar that supports the screen, but, nope.......wife said oh no to that!  ;)  BTW, desk to center of screen is 11\".It does tilt front to back, but the tilt to the front is about 5 degrees - not much.  To the back is fine.In summary..........a nice unit.  Check the height.  Consider more memory.

From a comfy low 40s C, leaping for no reason up to 70, 80, and once passing a frightening 95 C! I don't do any gaming or heavy lifting, and the temp freakouts happened under low loads and seemingly at random. Not a speck of dust to clog things up, either. I feared my upgrades had messed something up... I reset the fan control in the BIOS so it'd stay cranked all the time, and that helped, but it was LOUD! Tonight I realized some old thermal paste was in the electro-junk drawer, so I pulled the fan out, cleaned the old gunk off and re-pasted it. Set the fan BIOS back to normal. Bam! Sitting now at 41C for the CPU, 37C mainboard. Otherwise, I'm a happy camper.If I were less brash with digging into the components, I might have given up and returned this one, or not have known it was cooking like an air fryer in there until it was too late. So, the 4-star rating is a stretch. It's 4 stars AFTER some fiddling around.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 32G/1T SSD", "reviewImages": [], "position": 19}

I got the top of the line unit from this listing that has great specs, but adding this review to all the other lower end units in this listing is really unacceptable.  I'm tempted to dock a couple of stars just for that.You can see the impressive CrystalDiskMark ratings for the Kingston NVME SSD in these units https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-OM8PDP3512B-A01-512GB-PS5013-Custom/dp/B09NMFCQ49.  It also uses Kingston memory.  The unit has a WD Blue 1 TB spin drive that I didn't really benchmark since I had to replace it with an 18 TB Seagate, (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L5GQR5V), because while there is an extra SATA port on the motherboard, there's no way to mount a second spin drive.  Unfortunately the hole pattern for the 3.5\" drive only matches the WD bottom mount spacing and not the spacing for the Seagate, so I could only install two of the four screws and had to work around holding it properly without rattling the case.The lack of expandability is really my only complaint about this unit.  The specs are really impressive, with the overall Passmark rating being in the 92nd percentile.  It's about 2.5x the performance of the uber PC I'd put together using top of the line components for about four times the price about seven years ago.  However, this is not designed to be expanded.  It has room and motherboard connections for one 2.5\" drive, but that's about it.  Everything else, you'll be replacing components.  I can't tell for sure who makes the GEFORCE GTX 1660 card that's there without pulling it (can't find a matching picture anywhere) but it sits in the one PCIe x16 slot and unfortunately it's a two slot wide card that hides the extra PCI x1 slot that could have been used for at least some minor expansion.  The two onboard M.2 slots are taken with the NVME drive and the Wi-Fi card.  Upgrading to the max supported 32 GB of memory means throwing away the 16 GB it comes with.The spin drive mounts on a neat removable panel just under the case cover.  The blue cable you see in the pictures is the one I added to connect a 1 TB SSD into the 2.5\" bay.  The unit has an ultra-thin form factor DVD drive but I needed Blu-ray.  It was cheaper to just add an external than trying to replace the one that's in it.Beyond that, there is one big deficiency that WILL affect the average user.  Where are the USB 3.0 ports?!!  There's only one on the back and one USB 3.0 A and one USB-C on the front.  The rest are all USB 2.0?  What the heck?!!  I'm immediately having to add USB 3.0 hubs just to connect everything I'd typically use, including the external Blu-ray.  Not very convenient.So, overall this highest end unit in this listing is pretty impressive specs in a nice lightweight case.  For the average user, this is probably more than enough and the lack of expandability won't be an issue.  However, given I was upgrading from a machine with better specs all around except for speed, the inability to expand it had me considering pulling the components into a larger case with a different motherboard.  Frankly, from the feature list, this is really a laptop in a mini tower case.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "processor_description: i7-12700F/GTX1660 SuperStyle: Tower only", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cHtT4NL3L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51d3nX4KNyL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ByN2V1qZL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZnSTtoj-L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71arM6l7tRL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mzkBtw8kL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KI1TcKJPL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fK-tBtIML._SY88.jpg"], "position": 1}

So a low cost PCI-E Expansion Card with 2 USB Type-A and 2 USB Type-C Ports, SINEFINE (Amazon $16.99) filled the PCIe x4 slot and added plenty of ports.

The multi-core processor performance far exceeded my expectations coming 4th with a score of 12391 in Cinebench and 2nd in the single-core performance with a score of 1437.The built-in NVMe in my unit is made by KIOXIA as shown in one of the pictures. The reading speed on this M.2 SSD is not as fast as I‚Äôd hoped. The other computers I use or have used with an M.2 SSD had reading speeds that exceeded 2530 MB/s, whereas this KIOXIA SSD has a reading speed of roughly 1780 MB/s as shown in the CrystalDiskMark screenshots from the tests I performed on it. The writing speed is relatively good at 1320 MB/s. Even though the reading speeds are lower than my expectations, I didn‚Äôt find it to be an issue at all for normal day-to-day use or for gaming, etc. I could mainly cripple the system if you are using an external hard drive to copy files from the computer, still, the difference would only be seconds or a couple of minutes.I used photoshop and premiere pro for photo and video editing on this HP Pavilion Desktop Computer and found it to be very fast and snappy. The videos didn‚Äôt take much time to render or export on premiere pro, definitely much shorted that the time it takes on my Dell XPS 17 9710.This computer is a beast for gaming as well, unfortunately, that display I have right now has a refresh rate of 60 Hz so I couldn‚Äôt test the gaming performance to the fullest at higher refresh rates but I don‚Äôt see running games on 120Hz, 144Hz, 160Hz being an issue at all for this computer. It comes with a built-in app for AMD Radeon performance tweaking which I found very elegant and useful.The fans can run quite loud when you‚Äôre performing power-consuming tasks such as heavy gaming or video rendering, etc. I didn‚Äôt find it to be a big issue, but you‚Äôll be able to hear the far spinning.The HP Pavilion Desktop Computer comes with the ‚ÄúMy HP‚Äù app which keeps track of drivers, updates, and the health of the computer, it also offers games and features like helping you transfer files between computers, etc. I found this HP software to be nicely designed and handy to use.This computer does NOT come with a CD/DVD player, but there‚Äôs space to add one yourself if you need to. To open the cover of this computer there‚Äôs only one screw you need to unscrew, and no screwdriver is provided in the box. You can use a standard screwdriver for this task though. There‚Äôs only one M.2 slot available, but there‚Äôs a PCI EXPRESS connection available to be used if needed.This computer comes with a wired keyboard and mouse in the box, I found them comfortable and easy to use. There are no built-in speakers or microphones but there are ports to connect your own external ones.It would‚Äôve been nice if they added a foldable handle on top of this case just to make it easier to carry and move around. There are no handles unfortunately and you have to be extra careful not to drop the computer if you‚Äôre moving it from one place to another.Overall,  I‚Äôm still surprised by the good performance of this computer. For this price, it‚Äôs a beast that can be used for gaming, photo, and video editing, and just about everyday activities.

This desktop computer is very simple, yet elegant in its own way.  There's no flashy lighting you see on so many gaming desktops.  This PC is built purely for workstation power.  It has an amazingly quick Ryzen 7 processor, paired with an adequate amount of RAM (16GB).  Unlike a lot of other PC's I see these days that only come with a single stick of memory, this one came with two, so it runs in dual channel, as any proper computer should.There are plenty of USB ports on both the front and back, and a welcome USB Type C also included on the front of the tower.  The technical specs page at the time of this writing is a very screwed up.  It states the Hard Drive is an 8GB SSD, but that's completely incorrect and would be wrong for any PC system today.  The included M.2 drive is a 512GB variant, unfortunately only capable of running 1.6gb/sec read and 1.2gb/sec write speeds.  There are considerably faster M.2 drives, even in the older gen 3 spec.Also on the tech specs page - again, as of the time of this writing, it lists a 7200rpm hard drive rotation speed.  There is absolutely no platter based hard drive in this computer system.  Only the single 512GB M.2 included, as seen in my photo's.  At least they got the processor, RAM, and amount of USB ports correct.If you are only comfortable buying a pre-built desktop computer then this is a solid solution for a fast and speedy workstation.  However, you can save yourself around $250 (at the time of this writing) and build a nearly identical computer, albeit with a better power supply, and a faster M.2 drive, which are advantages in my opinion.", "isVerified": false, "variant": "Pattern: Computer PC", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713eyELQJHL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O1RFcQPOL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rBcQ174oL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xPe8x5bGL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AYEH9NeaL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FQd2aLNAL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GUWfbjojL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LQA3wrP5L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rHvIzzzCL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 10}

The packaging the monitors and PC arrived in was very secure and everything inside the box was encased in air pads. The 19 inch monitors were much larger than I had anticipated, and the back plates and stands were easy to put on. My only quirk with this bundle, which is barely noticeable, is the VGA to HDMI adaptor that was included displays short on the monitor. However, if you take the time to adjust it, the space is not noticeable due to the black border around the monitors, causing it to entirely blend in. The PC is slim, and does not make a lot of noise or overheat. The PC itself does not connect to wifi, so the usb-wifi adapter included in the bundle is clutch.I did purchase a separate wireless keyboard and mouse because when reading the reviews, the mouse and keyboard in this bundle were not positively talked about, and in my own experience, they were also pretty cheap. I also connected a Bluetooth speaker to the PC because the preset speakers are, well, built-in PC speakers.Overall, the price and quality for the two monitors and the PC is incredible. I purchased this setup to do school and clinical work as I finish dental school, and to have my first home office setup. The dual monitors are perfect for me in dental school because I am able to tx plan and review radiographs at the same time through the two monitors.Whether you are in school, looking for a solid PC and monitors for the office, or are trying to find a cheap, reliable, and quality home office start-up computer, this is the moment I would suggest you press Add to Cart and stop the long search.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 5}

Upon setting the computer up, one of the monitors was blurry and pixelated.  I ran through the standard troubleshooting - swap cables, swap ports, make sure the adapters were removed, check the settings in Windows.  No dice.At that point, I sent a fairly detailed message to tech support outlining the problem and my troubleshooting steps. I received a reply asking me to do one of the troubleshooting steps that I'd already done. After a little back-and-forth, they offered to replace the monitor.  So far, so good.Being a renewed computer, it predated on-board WiFi.  SJ Computers provided a WiFi adapter.  By Sunday, I noticed that I kept losing WiFi connectivity.  I had to manually restart the computer several times to reconnect, and I kept having to fiddle with it, to the point where I couldn't actually get my work done.This is probably a good time to note that all of the software we use to run the business is cloud-based, so no Wifi, no work.  In addition to a broken monitor and intermittent WiFi issues, the computer started then randomly restarting on its own.  I was now at the point where I'd spent more time trying to keep this unit working than I'd been able to spend doing my work. I am aware that in purchasing a renewed computer, these things can happen - so even though I was thoroughly frustrated, it was just a thing that could have happened and since the old computer still worked, easy enough to reverse and move on.Tech support called me and said they could walk me through the intermittent WiFi issues.  I explained again the series of issues I was experiencing (pixelated monitor, WiFi and random restarts) and told the gentleman I just wanted to return the unit.  He (Frank, I believe?) issued the return tag and we were good to go, or so I thought.After a frustrating weekend, I sit down to dinner on Sunday night and I get another phone call from SJ Computers.  There is a woman on the line, whose name I shall intentionally leave out.  She starts trying to get me back in touch with tech support.  As politely as possible (which probably wasn't very polite at that point - I'll admit) I declined.  I had already repackaged the computer and was home for the day.  She then starts trying to get me to leave a 4- or 5-star review telling me her job and her pay depended on it. Emotional blackmail, much?  I informed Anonymous Customer Service Rep that should I leave a review - my review would be completely honest: the computer didn't work, given the number and types of issues I had, I was not particularly willing to try their products again but I realized it was a used computer, things happened and up until that point, I had no issues with anyone to whom I had spoken.And then she escalates.  She offered me a \"gift\": wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, or anything else I might want if I would promise to leave her a 4- or 5-star review.  Yes.  This is an actual bribe.  And the conversation went on for several minutes, with her repeating the need for me to leave a 4- or 5-star review so her pay didn't get docked and offering gifts in exchange for that rating.  I informed her I did not want the gift and that my review, if left, would be an honest one.Had Anonymous Customer Service Rep not tried to emotionally blackmail me and bribe me, I would have most likely never left a review at all, but here we are.

The reason I had to try this is due to the i5-1135G7 processor. My need to buy a mini PC was to live stream and watch YouTube videos along with some light web browsing in my 2nd office room that we created recently. And this mini-PC sparkles on all the breakthroughs set by me. I have tried other mini-PC in the past but the experience was not good with them due to their super slow speed.Now talking about this product, you need to understand that this is not meant for overwhelming utilization, and over-clocking is constrained for the execution of heavy apps. I have used it fairly for 7 days and my review is exclusively based on this brief usage with the gadget. I will update my review in the future in case my point of view changes during the long-run usage.My 2 cents below :Pros:- Decent configuration: Intel i5-1135G7 processor with 4 cores & 8 threads. Its base operating frequency is 2.40 GHz/s rising to a 4.20 GHz in burst mode- Intel Iris Xe Graphics is an add-on to calibrate as per your need- PC performance is good enough for the processor and with 16 GB DDR4 RAM. Doesn't slow down the operation drastically while running the latest windows. RAM is expandable to 64GB maximum- High HD video including 4K run so smoothly without any issues. Have tried YouTube, Netflix, Apple TV, and many online free content providers.- PC supports triple display with 4K@60Hz output- Has WiFi6 inbuilt and hence up to the latest standards- Mini-PC runs decently fast even when I do multitask- No issue with web browsing either. I have parallelly used multi-tabs without any issue and playing multiple youtube windows together definitely works as well- It has WIFI (both 2.4 and 5ghz) & Bluetooth 5.2. My Keyboard/Mouse connected works flawlessly via Bluetooth- Multiple I/O ports: 4 USB 3.0 ports, 1 Type-C port, 1 Gigabit Ethernet port, 1 HDMI port, 1 DP port & an audio 3.5mm jack port. This should suffice for most of the needs- The device itself is very light and portable- This is a very good looking device with a nice design aesthetics- Comes with a monitor VESA mount & hardware to place it behind the screen- Licensed version 64bit Windows 11 Professional is pre-installed- Comes with 512 GB M.2 SSD already installed in it. SSD is expandable to 4TB maximum- It doesn't overheat. Thanks to the fan beneath it. I kept it on with video playing for 3+ hours and still went good- Comes with an HDMI cable in the box- Manual has detailed directions in it to refer to if needed- Setup process was easy and quick. Everything was ready within 10 minutes- 1-year worry-free warranty providedCons:- Yes, it does have a fan and so does the noise. Sometimes more when the PC runs the heavy job but I would say it's a trade-off to keep the PC running efficiently without any issues and I am completely okay with it- There are no DP cables included in the package- I wish it had 2 HDMI at least- No TF card port to add additional storage if neededConsidering the cost and convenience in a room where you do not need to put through a huge CPUs, I profoundly suggest this product.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: Intel Core i5-1135G7 / 16GB+512GB", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eW54TKZeL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LI98hh1lL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LxL6d1vML._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SMzn9Cl0L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WdxovOxoL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719TymcLovL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H0o6c8iAL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L6-ksE09L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X2Hs3PH9L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y5BPQR02L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71beTd0uC5L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rqPQ+oXCL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zyHKOqRLL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818eK4C0StL._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81s-DR0qp3L._SY88.jpg"], "position": 1}

I'm 58 years old and I did not get my first computer until I was 35 years old. My first computer had Windows 98 and it was fairly easy to figure out and use. Unfortunately the next operating systems and computers I've had since were difficult for me to operate. The fact is I'm tech challenged and I've been frustrated with each new OS and computer I've had, until now. My last computer was getting old and was still running Windows 8.1 and I knew it was time to upgrade. I contacted a close friend whom is very tech savvy and asked him for a recommendation and this is the computer he recommended. I didn't even know it was a mini computer when I ordered it so when I got it I was sort of shocked and confused by how small it is, 2x2x5. Anyway I called my buddy and questioned what I had bought and he reassured me it was fine. So I loaded what ever I wanted to save off the old computer onto a flash drive then mounter the new mini computer onto the back of my monitor and turned it on. The first thing I noticed is it is fast, as in very fast. Within a few minutes I was loading the files off the flash drive into it and in less than an hours time I was using the new computer. I've been using it for over a month so far and not once has it done any of the stupid and annoying things my old computers did. I also noticed it shuts itself off a while after I stop using it and when I turn it back on it fires right up and is ready to rock just about instantly. There is only one problem now. When I go to work and have to deal with the computers there, they do a lot of the stupid stuff my old computers did and it's frustrating. If you're like me and are frustrated with your computer get this ASBS computer and see what I'm talking about. An added bonus is I now have a nice open space that the old bulky computer tower occupied so I gained storage space and I will use it well.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: Intel Core i7-10810U / 16GB+512GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 4}

If it was as expensive as it is now, I probably would have not spent the money since I never tried a mini PC before. I have always built my computers (probably 20 or so for myself and others) so I was a little hesitant to buy a box that I can probably never fix if something breaks. I will probably never build another PC, these are powerful enough for daily computing and a little more. Comparing prices to the parts to build a system pr one of these, I think these are the future of home computing. I do not game with it so I can't give any info there... I use it as a Home Theater PC and for general computing and it is great, very fast.The Windows 11 was easy to activate (do not connect to the Internet until you are done with initial setup). I can routinely put this to sleep with no crashes on wakeup and I love that it is almost perfectly silent.The only cons are: Drivers not straightforward. Basically the support you get for the OS is an image, if you want to update individual drivers, do so at your own risk (if you can find them!) I wanted to update my video driver because of the second issue...Every once in a while  (maybe every two weeks or so) there will be some kind of problem with the video display to my HDMI TV. It looks like some kind of raster problem... very fine horizontal lines moving in the picture which makes it look blurry. When it starts happening, it will be rastered for a couple of seconds and return to normal... then rastered and return to normal. Sometimes it will simply stop happening, other times  have to restart and it goes away. It seems to happen when I have multiple video windows running... security cameras, Youtube, Pluto, etc. It happens to the whole PC, not just the video windows. Not sure if it is hardware, driver or what but it isn't annoying enough to return it.Overall I would highly recommend Mini PCs in general and this is a very good one!", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: Intel Core i5-1135G7 / 16GB+512GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 5}

I should note that I'm not a gamer, so my requirements are relatively modest.I was quite surprised by the ease of setup.  Pretty close to plug & play.  I needed only to buy a couple of HDMI to DisplayPort adapters and I was done.  Stock Windows 11 Pro was up and running within minutes of unboxing.  It's been running continuously for about two months hanging off the back of a monitor, completely out of the way, and it's barely warmer than room temperature, despite being absolutely silent.  It's everything I had hoped for.A word about customer service - after about a month, I started getting Blue Screens (it happens.  I don't fault the seller).  I ran numerous diagnostics and determined it was most likely (though not definitively) a memory problem.  I contacted the seller and, literally within a few hours, was given instructions on how to reinstall the system.  When that didn't resolve the problem, I was offered a replacement PC, which I graciously accepted.  I received the replacement even before I had packed up the defective unit.  I sent the old unit back and was instantly reimbursed for shipping.  I was fully restored within, I believe it was 5 days, but that was mainly due to my slow response replying to emails, not the seller's.Bottom line is that I would have no reservation recommending ASBS to a friend who was looking for a mini-PC, or, indeed, if I need a second unit in the near future.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: Intel Core i7-10810U / 16GB+512GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 6}

I reached out to support@kamrui.com and received a quick response reiterating the advice in the Q&A section on Amazon (which I had skipped over) to do the following:To avoid initial setup issues, the first time you use this mini pc,1)Please don't connect network or wifi until the windows system of your mini pc is running. No need to fill in the mailbox, skip this step, you can use the machine normally.2)If you have connected to WIFI when it can not load into windows, please turn off the router you are using.3)If you only use the wired network to connect the mini pc, please unplug the wired network directly, restart the machine, and keep the machine disconnected from the network.Once I heeded that advice the installation completed quickly.One other issue I had was with the Ethernet connection ‚Äì it just won‚Äôt work with a 10/100 switch but replacing that with a Gigabit switch worked fine.I would definitely purchase this machine again but would recommend a more robust processor for anyone more interested in gaming than I.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 10}

My CPU cooler went out and thought I'd look at a mini PC because it didn't cost a big amount more and I wanted something quieter and less heat. Enter this SER5.After watching some reviews and looking at the motherboard, I decided to give it a try. To my amazement, it works better than I expected. While I was setting it up, it felt responsive and doing simple tasks worked as well or better than most Windows tablets I've had that were light weight. Win11 was pre-installed, so I kept it and just cleaned it up a bit to get the M$ bloat removed.I'm not using this strictly as a user device, so I can't say how well it holds up to everyday use or running UI intensive apps/games. The GPU shares RAM, so even though you might think you have 16GB RAM on this, you don't. I had thought I could adjust the GPU RAM allocation in the bios, although I haven't found an option for it yet.That leads to my only issue with this machine. The web site for Beelink looks like it was made in 2005. Navigating is sloooww. Finding anything related to support about this particular model doesn't exist. The closest thing you'll find is an obscure link on the contact page that shows they have a forum. Getting any kind of reply there must require you to hold your head a certain way and let you tongue hang out a particular side because I've been waiting 3 days for a response on the BIOS version. Beelink's take on updating your BIOS for some silly reason is that you need to supply a picture of you machine's S/N so they can give you an exact version. I've seen some comments in the forums that it is too easy for users to flash the wrong BIOS. Well, someone send some notes to Gigabyte, MSI, ASUS and all the other manufacturers out there because I've been able to download BIOS for over 20 years. Hopefully one day someone will respond as from what I can tell, I need the update in order to change the GPU RAM.In the end, it's not the end of the world on the BIOS or support. I'm comfortable cracking a case and operating on a board, so other than downloads, I don't plan on needing their support. For the price of the machine and performance I've seen so far setting up some game servers, I'm happy otherwise. If this machine holds out well over the next 6 months or so, I'll probably get another (maybe more recent model) for other needs.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: R5-5500U 16G+500G", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

A 500gb crucial nvme with pcie 4 speeds as I confirmed the model number online after disassembly. The wifi card is replacable too and there's a spot for a 2.5 old fashioned ssd but it blocks a fan above the nvme so idk if its worth having tbh but good incase.I installed Linux and ubuntu runs perfectly. Emulation wise, everything up to switch emulation will run including rpcs3. Surprisingly rpcs3 runs perfect than on my rtx desktop build so amd has am edge here even with integrated graphics. Yuzu however is 50/50 youll get drops in the really heavy intensive games like botw and scarlet/violet (which is already a mess to begin with) os unplayable since choppy and graphics pop in randomly. Thats the verdict on emulation and not the fault of the device but the current state of the emulators etc. Dolphin and below run perfectly.Power wise it never pulled more than 80w even on full yuzu rendering. I didnt run native pc games but its definitly cost effective electricity rate wise. The only downside is you will need two things to fully replace a desktop with that im surprised it wasent taken into account. Buy a usb audio splitter to run external speakers if you use external speakers. There is a headphone jack in the front but id rather the speaker plug not be in the front and ruin looks so usb audio splitter is req 1 to buy.The second is a usb hub lol. Two ports in the back will be filled almost always with mouse and kb, if you need anything else (like a usb audio splitter) then you'll be using front ports also ruining looks. So a hub to split 1 port to 4 and gives you 4 slots to expand(mouse /kb/audio/ ???).All in all this is a great device. Longevity wise  i have no idea since this is my first build but for general usage and emulation gaming you cant go wrong. People online have run native games like forza etc and it still produces a stable framerate which is great if thats your thing.Monitor situation: can theoretically use 3 since front USB c is usable for display in addition to the two hdmi. Idk what the hdmi ports are rated at but when i tested a dual monitor 144hz qhd each build it had 100hz options which was strange but I feel that 60hz is the safest best. Target 60hz and 60fps and you'll be fine.Fan noise is non existant which was shocking considering laptops ignite in heat and noise while this just stays a stable cool temp. Ofcourse if you load the cpu heavy for long periods of time itl heat up but that's the reality of everything. Cooling is definitly an improvement over other models I've tested.One random note ive noticed. Ubuntu recognizes the audio drivers as having a mic onboard but after testing it there's no input so i think this might be a component from a previous model that had a onboard mic. I took the device apart and still was unable to locate a physical mic port and bios is a mess to determine what's going on but if you're a privacy nut like me there is no cause for alarm for this.

Runs nice and quiet too!The performance for the price is excellent. It's more than enough for every day basic tasks or use as a media server (or travel computer), but in line with the advertising, it's a surprisingly good unit for gaming - within reason. The integrated Radeon 680M graphics on these new 7000-series Ryzen CPUs (used in this unit) is currently the best performing option on the market short of a dedicated GPU. While it won't work miracles on the most demanding games out there, it can handle a surprising amount of relatively recent titles in 1080p with good frame rates (esp. w/FSR enabled), and in a number of titles it outperforms the GTX 1050 Ti in my 2017 Desktop build - impressive stuff for integrated graphics!Even as a bit of a desktop purist to some degree, I'm a fan of these mini-PCs - they're really versatile (can be a desktop alternative for lighter use, good in a TV/media room setup, or even as a travel PC w/a portable monitor), and save a ton of energy over regular desktops for the things you can do with them.

A 100mm fan that bolted directly to the bottom with some feet to raise for air flow or even a plate to use with the wall mount would be an easy implementation I feel and possibly help lower the internal temps.

I currently own a three year old refurbished Lenovo M82 with essentially the same specs as this machine.  I wanted to buy my son a new machine to replace his old one, so I went looking for another refurbished Lenovo.  I found this M93p model.  It has all the specs I was looking for... a fast I5 processor, a 256 Gig SSD, a DVD, and 8 Gig of ram.  I could have bought a lower priced machine, and then upgraded its standard hard drive with a faster solid state drive (once you have experienced SSD speed you can never go back), but decided this machine was what I wanted for ultimately the same final price.  I'm very pleased with this machine.  It is extremely clean, inside and out.  In fact, it looks brand new.  After going through the Win 10 installation/registration  process, I was up and running.  It came with OpenOffice installed.  The supplied USB wifi adapter works fine.  It came with a keyboard and a wired optical mouse.  Both are usable, but cheap.  I expected as much, so that is no problem.  My son has a good keyboard and mouse he can use. This particular machine also came with two serial ports, and get this... one parallel printer port!  I have not seen a parallel printer port in many many years.  Most unusual.  I did not recognize the provided SSD manufacturer, but it seems to work fine.  Its speed tested reasonably fast.  Its reliability is yet to be determined.  In retrospect, maybe I should have bought the cheaper machine, and then upgraded to a SSD I have experience with.  Time will tell.  The mother board had two 4 Gig memory cards installed, leaving two empty slots.  I added two more 4 Gig cards for $32, bringing the total memory up to 16 Gig.  System recognized all the memory fine.  As a test, I installed Google Earth from the internet, and another application from the DVD player.  The machine is fast, and everything works great.  Again, I am very pleased with this machine.  My son should be as well.  He should get many years of service from this computer.  ...Merry Christmas.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 3}

I suspect it is not optimal for gaming as you might have to change the power supply and video card, but for everything else, including SW development, it is excellent.I had problems with my unit and learned that when a PC is new and within the time window to return it, do not mess with Customer Service, return it and buy a new one.My NEW Envy was locking. (Had to do a hard reset to recover control.) I trusted HP was professional and had my interest at heart. I will NOT make that mistake again. They had me mail my PC to them. I expected a new motherboard or just a new PC. Instead they replaced the fan. This means that my NEW unit was stressed thermally with an unknown long term effect -- it might fail after the warranty period because of the stress.The whole process took about a month. (Diagnosis with a tech on-line, mail box here, mail PC there, wait, fix, mail PC back) only to find that the DVD drive door was broken. New claim (even though I emailed HP same day it was returned.) Then mail box here, mail PC there, Mail back fairly quickly this time. Now, here's the second rub. The original door had a small spring installed making it work nicely. This spring cannot be replaced manually, so it was mailed back with a new door, but no spring (takes automated machinery to insert that spring.)So I lost over a month of usage, HP did not even offer to extend the warranty to cover the down time. The unit was stressed thermally to an unknown effect. The door works, but not as nicely as the original.So am I pleased with HP? Furious is a better term. I own four HP PCs (can supply serial numbers on demand) and an HP Deskjet printer. Over the years I have owned many more HP PCs and printers. I like HP equipment. BUT I now recommend that if anything appears wrong within the 'return' period, return it immediately and buy another.

I spent months looking for a decent starter PC which would allow me to play all my games and  store my content effectively while maintaining speed and quality.  I wanted something that was visually appealing and functional. Personally, I‚Äôm a broke college kid who needed an outlet to balance school and fun. I wasn‚Äôt sure where to begin my search, and had no idea what requirements and features were required to have an effective and quality PC.  In this review, I‚Äôm putting you in the same position as me when I started looking through the PC marketplace. When beginning the search for your first PC, the search can be incredibly overwhelming and daunting. However, you are doing an amazing job searching if the internet miraculously placed you with this item.Let‚Äôs break down the features of the PC. This computer is a pre-built, which means there is no assembly required on your part. There‚Äôs a plethora of components that make a PC worth buying, and I‚Äôm going to break down the specifics of each component and how they correlate to the performance and quality of your gaming. The primary function of any PC is the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU, also known as the processor, is responsible for executing and refining the power of the computer and directly affects how fast your computer, or computer games, run. The CPU also processes the inputs from the user. The CPU included in this pre-built is an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3rd Generation. Another important factor in the PC is the RAM. RAM stands for random access memory. The purpose of RAM is to store short term data and allow the computer to process applications properly. RAM‚Äôs data is temporarily stored while applications are currently operating, like having a game playing. This PC includes an 8 GB card, which means if your game requires around 8 GB of RAM, your game will function and run properly. If you‚Äôre not sure about a game‚Äôs required RAM, the developers include those requirements in the breakdown and analytics of each game. The RAM only holds the contents of the game for the duration you are playing. Once the application is shut off, the RAM is no longer active.While RAM is temporary storage, the hard drive processor is not. The hard drive is responsible for keeping your saved digital storage. For example, the space required for saving your game or Microsoft Office software. The hard drive also stores pictures, videos, and the applications you have downloaded on your PC. Hard drives can be external or internal, which means saving data to an external memory device or to the PC itself, and the contents can be deleted or cleared once you no longer need them. The hard drive included in this pre-built is a 500 GB SSD card.You can store up to 500 gigabytes of content as soon as you start up the PC.  While those features are required for every PC, even for basic processes and storage, this review will highlight the rest of the features through a gaming perspective since this is a gaming PC. The graphics card is responsible for rendering the images and content in a game and running them effectively. It renders the movements, animations, inputs, and images that are in a game through a series of fast acting calculations completed internally in the PC. The graphics card included in this PC is a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6G GDDR5, which holds 6 GB of RAM.If you are a little confused about whether or not your graphics card is going to make or break your gaming experience, multiple YouTube creators offer a compilation of benchmark videos with clips and segments from video games with demanding animation and experiences. The benchmark videos include multiple different video games from varying genres that allow gamers to evaluate how well the game is running and performing according to the graphics card.  In regard to usability and functionality of the PC, the developers include a detailed pamphlet that illustrates how to properly connect your PC to a monitor, how to enable your microphone and speakers, and the purpose of each feature throughout the PC. The PC does require a three-prong plug, and I recommend plugging the cord into a direct power source, like a wall outlet, instead of a surge protector or extension cord.When plugging in a monitor, there are two different HDMI ports on the back of the PC for up to 2 different monitors to be used simultaneously. Computer speakers should have a USB port to plug into the back of the PC, and headsets unfortunately require a splitter to listen to music and use a microphone concurrently. Splitters are cords that connect to the aux section of your headphone cord, and it divides this cord into two auxiliaries that can be plugged into two corresponding holes. The PC permits one USB powered keyboard and one USB mouse. These assets are included in the Amazon listing.This PC in particular is incredibly visually appealing.  It features a white tower, which is the casing around all the important parts of the PC, with a tempered glass window on the side to look into the tower. It also has multiple RGB lights and various functions. There are seven varying lighting functions to encourage individuality and styles. Located around the lighting fixtures are three fans to cool the system down. The fans blend in with the circular lighting fixtures. The PC is very cohesive in design, and incorporates each feature into the overall aesthetic of the computer. Overall, I believe this PC is a quality starter PC within its budget of $1200. It strives in multi-tasking, allowing the user to edit documents while having a YouTube video or music running in the background. I have been using this system for school and gaming for around eight months, and have had no issues with it. I give it an A for price point, functionality, and visual appeal. I believe this is an ideal PC for a casual gamer who wants something to balance work and entertainment with.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 1660 SuperPattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

My first PC is over 2 years old at this point and I was looking to actually just upgrade it's GPU but everything I was looking for was out of stock or outrageously priced (at the time a 1660 Super was running near $400).  So settled on this machine, it had many of the parts I was looking to get myself: AMD 5 3600, 16GB RAM, GTX 1660 Super, B450 Motherboard (though I had looked at B550).I am not disappointed.  The machine is wonderful and came delivered without single flaw.  It booted on the first try and immediately went into Windows all the RGB elements performed perfectly.  I ran a series of tests after it finished setting up windows and was pleased to see that the SSD was not a total disgrace as some had stated before, getting about 530 MB/s sequential read times at 1Gib and 514 MB/s Write.  That's not blazing fast, but it was better than I expected after reading reviews.  I received an ADATA SU720 500GB model drive in my build and these Read/Write times are right on par with the stated performance for that drive, so I have no complaints.  I dropped a NVMe drive in right away as well as a smaller 256GB solid state drive for games and other files.  Storage was my only real concern with the build, but adding storage is not an issue (though it is a bit hard to get power cables up from the power supply, the cords are all quite well bundled and I had to cut a zip tie to get a free power cable for my SSD).  Unlike the pictured model my build came with a B450M/AC so it had the Wi-Fi built in to the motherboard, rather than in a PCI slot.  This was a pleasant surprise and also meant the motherboard had 4DIMM slots instead of 2 (like I saw some people received in their builds).  The RAM I got was OLOY Brand, which is actually Chun Well Technologies and it was just standard RAM, no heat spreaders or anything fancy, but it was strong memory, running 16-18-18-36 at 1.3v with a clock speed of 100Mhz at a 15x multiplier, giving you 1500Mhz DDR, so in total it matches the 3000Mhz advertised.  I am unsure what brand GPU I got, but I suspect by the I/O panel (DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort) it is an MSI Brand.  Its a single fan, compact unit and I am quite happy with it, though I would have preferred a model without DVI and instead a second DisplayPort or HDMI port.  In all I am very pleased with this machine, the quality, the build, the parts, and performance are all above what I anticipated and as a Cyber Monday deal for $200 off list it was pretty much a bargain.Edit:  so Cyberpunk 2077 has dropped and despite the poor reception I had it running at a smooth 60fps @1080p on this machine.  I am not a crazy hardcore gamer looking for 4k and Ray Tracing, I was quite happy that my new PC ran the game with no hardware related problems and a strong graphical performance.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 1660 SuperPattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510jv8-SIJL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0YpcjorL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CJBiGzPyL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eXhQr1kAL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81609ZRC65L._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dgp--yg1L._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UePTUkDiL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VKcGkTyhL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZHLY4VJvL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81klDHSkwiL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vsDeoAwKL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vsDeoAwKL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 3}

All of the boot discs came with it. Basically hook it up and start it up and it's ready. The mid tower chassis has room to customize and add different things if you would like. The PC comes with 4 fans 3 RGB and 1 3pin fan. 3 fans are set to exhaust and the 1 3pin is set as intake. That was one of my issues right there. The three exhausts moved air fine. The one intake being on the front of the case which also doesnt let much air move because it's a slim vent on the side of the case caused the air to be very extremely negative and had air pulling into the case from every crevice. In the end I had to add 2 more fans to the front of the case. Even now the air is still slightly negative due to case design. Another issue I have with this PC is that the 3 RGB fans that come with it are rigged to the led bar that is on the front of the case. They are powered by a sata 3 adapter (molex) but the interesting thing is they run off a 4pin rgb cable that's daisy chained from all 3 fans and the led strip, there isnt a fan cable, I guess they are 2 pin fans  rigged to run off the power supply? I havent tried hooking anything daisy chained to the open connector to see if that theory was correct. With this setup though it leaves most of your rgb headers empty. The problem is you cant sync to those fans, havent tried hooking them to one of the headers because I have no clue how many amps they pull since the fans are hooked into that connector also. Another thing with the fan setup was the dual fans on the GPU would start to spin up faster and the case would get loud from those to fans. Since I added the new fans this hasnt been an issue. So with 2 more fans it actually run more quiet overall. That's why I dropped it to 4 stars. Now to why it goes down to 3 stars. The motherboard comes with built in wifi. You are supposed to get 2 antenna with the PC. Mine came with only one. So I got into chat with skytech, friendly customer service guy told me he would ship one right out to me with an email confirmation. Well, its 2 months later and I'm still waiting for either thing. Hopefully if something else goes wrong I dont have that issue. Computer runs really good at 1080p on high setting on demanding games. 1440p on higher demanding games it starts to lose frames and gets sluggish, less demanding games I was able to run 4k fine. So this machine isnt going to be an ultra setting machine unless your playing something older. Overall it was cheaper to buy this (it was on sale at the time) than to build something similar since PC parts are crazy priced right now. With it not being on sale you could build it for around $800 if dig for the parts. I got it cheaper than that. If you dont dig for the parts this build could cost around $1200. It took 2 months but changed to 4 stars since they finally sent me my antenna.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 1660 SuperPattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u5ZNtbEBL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 5}

Great value and decent parts!Its been 84 years since I last set foot... well it feels that long since I was last in the market for a new gaming rig. I'm upgrading from a 9 year old Cyberpowerpc-amd phenom-gtx960 build (RIP). Long overdue for an upgrade.I didn't recognize the Skytech brand so I looked at some amazon reviews, their website, and the Better Business Bureau. Come to find out they are new  company (1yr old) and not accredited at the BBB. So, I read some more reviews at the BBB site. Most of the negative reviews were people that were impatient waiting for tech support or frustrated with the rma process and bummed about having a brick. One thing that I noticed was that all of the complaints lodged against them (there were 3) were resolved.I decided to take a chance on them. The package came 1 day ahead of schedule which was nice. But, when I saw the condition of the packaging I was concerned. It looked like Wolverine had slashed the top of the box (check out the pic). When I opened the package everything seemed well placed and secured.The first thing I noticed on this machine was the side tempered glass panel. It works on a hinge and magnet system which is super convenient and easy to access. Once I unpacked everything and took out the expanding foam that wraps the components (carefully), I checked all of the power and data connections. Everything was plugged in and snug but i noticed that the cable management was very tight, especially under the shroud where the power supply is. There is a 3.5 in HDD bay down there that is going to be difficult to access because it's partially blocked by the cables. Other than that the cable management is clean enough. The keyboard and mouse were umm... usable... Ive definitely had worse.I checked all of the components to make sure my device matched my product description, everything seemed good. I was a little worried because the video card looked smaller than I expected. Turns out that it is a PNY single fan card, smaller than most 1660 Supers but seems to be up to par.Next I crossed my fingers and hit the power button. First there were lights... beautiful RGB goodness coming from 3 case fans and the front panel. Next, the ASRock boot screen (Almost there). Finally the Windows setup screen and a sigh of relief. Windows setup went well, no issues. Startup after initial setup takes less than 20 seconds.I ran NZXT Cam software to get some info on the components and monitor cpu/gpu loads and temps. Idle temps are normal and the case seems to have good airflow.I can play RDR2 at 1080p at a solid 60fps with mostly high/ultra settings, I had to lower the water quality and reflections to keep above 60 frames.

I purchased this machine for video editing. So my rating on the 'gaming' stars is to be taken with a grain of salt. However, judging it by the way it handles video editing...I'm sure it's solid.Though my old machines were working well, Adobe has designed their latest software to only work well with upgraded hardware. I was behind the curve with 4th and 5th gen intel processors. I have only had some working experience with AMD. But this Ryzen 5 3600 is amazing!After I went through the process of setting it up, I immediately ran a test with the current documentary I am working on. Previous to this machine, I tried several times to render 2, 4 hour interviews with timecode burned in to hand off to the producer. Each time it clocked at 12-16 hours and would either crash or fail at 99%. Frustrated to no end and wasting literal DAYS trying to render, I purchased this bad mF'er. My first test...rendered the first 4 hour interview in under an hour!!!!! (HD video). Immediately, I knew I made the correct choice. I have not tried to tax it yet with 4K video but I'm guessing it will handle it well.Why only 4 stars? Well, as some have pointed out (and I knew this going in), the wifi is pretty weak. I had to move it really close to my router (which is not near my office) in order to run updates and install the programs I needed. Also, the sound isn't good at all. Fortunately, I have an external USB Behringer sound box. Once I hooked that up, the sound was good to go!I have no issues with the supplied mouse and keyboard with the exception of a short cable on the mouse. I am unable to feed the mouse to the back of the box as a righthander and have enough wiggle room with my desk set up. An extender will fix this.It would be great if there was more than one extra PCI connection on the motherboard since the video card takes up so much room. This will limit putting in an internal sound card, a better wifi card and an external sata  card that I use to dock drives. Again, I knew this when buying. So it's more of me not taking the time to really look.  I was also unaware (on my part) that there was no space in the case for a DVD burner. Not a big deal for today's standards but I still have to occasionally burn DVD's for clients. An external will fix this.I was able to add an internal 7200 drive for storage with ease and I will soon be adding a few SSD's easily for the storage I need for editing.Overall, I am impressed. Skytech did a great job putting this thing together and though it is not a performance deal, I do love the LED lights and changing colors. Makes this thing look like a work of art! Beyond my minor complaints (all of which, I knew going in) I would totally go back to Skytech for a future upgrade. But I think I'm going to be good for a while.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 1660 SuperPattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": [], "position": 7}

Having done some comparative shopping, I settled on this model, and after the first few days of using it, I am completely satisfied, with just a couple of things to be aware of, mentioned below.Pros:* Very tight and clean build, with a lot internal case space to spare.* Shipped very quickly, using Amazon Prime's free shipping.* Competitive pricing for the included parts - RAM, SSD, Motherboard and Graphics Card.* More than capable of handling any of today's games, or multi-tasking for business.* Comes with LED gaming keyboard and mouse.* LEDs are synced between the case fans (which you can see through the clear glass side panel), and the front panel of the case.  A button on the case lets you cycle between colors (or turn them off).Cons:* The included motherboard is small.  There are 2 RAM slots, and if you use the included WiFi card, there are no additional slots for more PCIe components.  To upgrade the RAM, you will have to replace an existing card, rather than just adding to what is already included.* In my build, the graphics card and WiFi cards are so close together, that when I first turn on the PC, there is a rattle sound, as the graphics cards' fan vibration makes the card tap against the WiFi card.  In my case, this goes away after settling for a few seconds, and the PC is very quiet afterward.* If you want to install a disk drive (not SSD), you will have to do some digging.  There is not an available mount directly inside the case.The parts are essentially of the 2019 generation.  You may be able to find another model with a graphics card that is newer.  However, at the time of this writing, I was unable to find a better overall purchase for the price on Amazon or any other site, and I believe this is and will be fully capable of playing any games released for several years to come.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 1660 SuperPattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": [], "position": 8}

The first time I loaded it up I was shocked that it had none of the essential drivers installed on it. I couldn‚Äôt open a single game in Steam because of it. After installing everything, it still didn‚Äôt work. I restarted my PC and it was stuck on the loading screen for an hour so I decided to completely wipe it out and start fresh. It was working perfectly for a few hours and had everything installed once I hard reset it (I have no idea how). I was happy I fixed the problem and I shut it down to go to bed. I woke up a few hours later and the computer is bricked now and won‚Äôt even load up. Pressing F10 and trying to repair it comes up with ‚Äúfailed to repair‚Äù. Not to mention SkyTech isn‚Äôt taking any calls right now due to the virus. I waited two weeks for the computer to be delivered and sending it back will take even longer to get a new one and at this point I don‚Äôt want to take another computer from SkyTech. This is a horrible product. How it passed inspection, I have no idea.Updated Review : It turns out I had a bad SSD! I don't think that was a fault of Skytech's but none-the-less, it was broken and corrupted. I still think it was not put through the proper stress tests or driver inspection, BUT the way Skytech handled the situation has me changing my review from One star to FOUR. If I had received the proper SSD the first time I would be leaving five stars for sure, but after everything I went through with having to reinstall Windows 10 on a USB to my old SSD and having to reset it three times and the frustration, is why I'm taking off a star.SKYTECH HAS AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I could not contact anyone because their offices are closed due to COVID-19 so I reached out through Instagram of all places. I spoke with one of the representatives who was extremely apologetic and swore it was a busted SSD. She sent me another SSD free of charge one-day shipping and I installed it myself (it was very easy to do). It's been three days and ALL IS WELL, knock on wood, the machine is running like the machine I should have gotten the first time. AMAZINGLY. I recommend this company and this computer to anyone. I can record and stream 1080 60fps on Ultra settings!

Dell use to have both in the case and some extras like a mounting bracket, but not no more, probably saves them about 25 cents per computer. So off to order those. Then I needed to expand the number of USB ports for my needs just to find out that now I needed a longer SATA power cable as the supplied cable (that has been long enough for every Optiplex I've set up) was too short for the XPS a much more expensive computer. So off to get one of those .... huff!

You Tube videos are fantastic to watch on this big screen, as well as movies on Amazon Prime or Netflix. The screen is crystal sharp! Another thing that I love: the VOLUME that comes out of this unit is top notch. In the past, all my laptops's volumes were not enough sometimes to hear videos (esp many YouTube videos). I'd have to use external speakers or plug in a headphone to hear what was being said. NOW, I often turn the volume DOWN, and never have to put it at max volume like I did with other computers. Finally!This model is not a touch-screen. I didn't want one. I prefer to use a keyboard and mouse. The camera on top of the screen works very nice. The only issue there is I can't tilt it very much up and down (I'd probably have to get a separate camera if I find I need to move it around often). But you can move the screen side to side easily. The screen is sturdy and a bit heavy (but not unbearably so), but I'm not lifting it around anyways.So, if you need a new laptop for travel, this is not the product for you. It's not really portable and the screen is certainly too big for that. But if you're looking at getting a unit to be put in place and stay there, this computer is excellent. No issues so far at all with it. Plenty of memory, easy to operate, beautiful sharp clear images. excellent speakers. I paid more for the big screen, but I'm so happy I did.

I want to in this case. This PC is awesome. I left a negative review. I want to change my review. I wish to state I I copied my first review and plan to paste it in at the end of this updated review. I no longer place blame on jack's shop or Minisforum. I now have had 3 PC's that failed because of Windows 11 updates. In each of those incidents this same thing occurred. As most of you know when installing a Windows update restarting the PC is part of the installation. My 3 PC's that got messed up all did the same thing. Windows update appeared to be installing normally during the shutting down phase. However, during the starting back up phase all I got was a black screen. So I now blame Microsoft. I read news yesterday. Many others besides myself has had the same thing happen. My advice is to use Windows 10 until this issue is resolved. Also many people have successfully installed this update I don't know how a person is to know in advance if their PC will install the update successfully. I do know nobody wants to deal with this. This was my original review: I connected it and used it for awhile (2 weeks) a short while then I was told Windows had an update. I thought sure update windows. The PC has never booted since. Before that update I used this PC and was so happy with it. When that update occurred I contacted Minisforum. They replied that I failed to update the BIOS. They were saying in a nutshell that it was my fault for not updating the BIOS. I had it only 2 weeks. I have updated a BIOS before. Straight out of the box it needs a BIOS update or it will crash because of Windows update. Really how was I to know it needed to have a BIOS update or Windows update will crash it. When it worked it was totally awesome. I am posting this to inform new buyers, the very first thing they should do is find out if they need to update the BIOS or they may have the same thing happen them. They sold me a Windows PC with a BIOS that can't handle a windows update. Then said it was my fault for not updating the BIOS. It wasn't my fault like they (Minisforum) says they sold me a new PC with a flawed BIOS. They didn't want to backup their product so they blamed me.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: UM690/32GB+512GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

I also like that they put additional rubber feet because I do need to remove them in order to remove the cover. Additionally, a 2.5 inch drive connection is present. The other thing provided is a VESA mount to connect this to the back of a display. And I'm really pleased with how little this thing is, because it makes the entire device more portable. In terms of the IO, we have the power button, reset CMOS button, microphone slash, headphone Jack, to fully functional USB C ports, and the video capable USBC port on the right. To keep the UM580 cool, it also includes a ton of various air vents located all around the unit.The alt mode USB C port, which is first and foremost on the left,can be used  one of two ways. One is simply plug it into the power brick. However, even though the power brick may have multiple ports, I would only use one and avoid plugging anything else at the same time to ensure that the main unit will receive constant power. If the monitor is capable of operating in Alt mode it can connect with just one cord. The monitor will power the mini PC and the mini PC will supply the video to the monitor. Unfortunately my monitor is not able to operate in Alt mode so I can't really comment on that. Monitors can provide 100 watts of power that this PC requires most of the times. These monitors will only provide 65 watts. More information regarding the back IO. Is that it includes a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connector, USB 3.2 Gen, 2 port, two HDMI outputs that can both produce 4K at 60 frames, and two USB 2.0 ports.I think that because it is mostly black, it blends into the background and also runs quite silently. I really enjoy the way it looks. I believe it would blend in well at the back of the monitor. For other specs, it features a Ryzen 7. 5800 H processor, 32 gigs of RAM, and 512 gigabytes with Windows 11 Pro installed. Therefore, this device will be excellent for 1080P video editing and perhaps some light 4K editing as well. In all honesty, I was hoping that this device would be great for media video editing, video encoding and video playback and I'm glad that delivered.In conclusion, I appreciate the genuine mini PC, small size, the fact that it  Has a little power brick and the ability to operate in alternate modes. These features make the mini PC, which is  already small, much more portable because I don't have to carry along the bulkier power supply.I like that the device can be upgraded on all fronts and that there is room for a 2.5 inch disc as well. This had dang good PC gaming performance, I wouldn't call it a gaming PC, but gosh, it can play a lot of games. I believe that emulation is where it really exceeds.

One of the usb 3.0 ports on the top is not recognized by the computer an issue I will get to at some point. I tried to put in my old hard drive and ssd drive which was difficult since the cords are so tightly wrapped and there is no real way to screw down a hard drive unless you take everything out to be able to get your hands and a screwdriver in there.

My other ssd drive is there next to that one also hard to screw in to stay in place so I just used some electrical tape to keep it in place in case I need to pick up the case.

I play games like Total War: Three Kingdoms, Battlefront 2, & Smite - and they all run on max settings.  The first game that I found that didn't default me to max settings was Resident Evil 3 (remake), and I really won't hold that against the machine because that game is absolutely gorgeous, and I doubt my Series X could hold out at absolute max PC settings.Anyways, yeah.

I do some graphics and some gaming so video performance was important. I have been in IT for years and used to build my own using the best graphics cards, best motherboards etc but am too old an busy for such things these days and wanted to see what a \"custom\" unit off the shelf on Amazon looked like. After doing benchmark testing, some really interesting things became apparent.The unit is beautiful, crafted well and unlike my first computer from Skytech (which was configured wrong) everything appears to have been installed correctly. FIt and finish are great and I love the fans and LED lights that give it nice curb appeal. I used Passmark software to benchmark this build. I highly recommend it to anyone. Passmark gives this build a 75% rating. From my experience this essentially means that it beats 75% of the people who have put their computers to the test recently. Since most of the users are geeks like me, that usually means that a higher bar is expected. Thus, the 75% rating is that this machine beats 75% of people who are spending money on a GOOD system.OVERALL: 75%CPU: 83%2D Graphics: 73%Gaming: 88%Memory: 58%What I found interesting is that this machine build is a monster when it comes to gaming and general computing power but is prevented from being a real killer because of some parts that they really failed on . The worst part of this machine is the SSD hard drive which received a 3% score in performance. The PNY CS900 is one of the WORST performing hard drives you could possibly pick. With out a doubt this 3% score affected the total performance of the build . In my experience, hard drive performance more than ANYTHING makes for a computer's performance and feel. The memory performance was also middle of the road. They could have spent the same amount of money and gotten better memory and for the love of god a DECENT hard drive. Literally the worst performing hard drive that costs the same or more than some stellar performers. I don't get it. This system could rock out with a marginal HD.

However, I am super impressed and so thankful that I chose this one! It is sooo worth the money! I started getting into PC gaming not too long ago, mainly playing Minecraft, and much more recently, Valorant. Both games ran like garbage on my old laptop, so I decided to upgrade - and let me tell you that this PC has not missed a BEAT! The only issues I've ever had with Valorant on this PC were due to internal issues with the game itself, not the PC. No lag AT ALL - same goes for Minecraft and a few smaller games I've played. Everything runs absolutely great! I will say I was a little worried when I opened the box up (I was hoping it hadn't gotten damaged during shipping), but it was actually packaged really nicely and came with a nice quick start guide, which was really useful for me, considering I've never set up a gaming PC before. Everything was hooked up properly internally, so it was plug and play after getting everything arranged the way I wanted on my desk, and I instantly loved the RGB lights! They're awesome! You can change the colors just by pressing a button on the top of the PC. I leave mine on the solid rainbow setting most of the time, but there are so many colors you can rotate through! The other nice thing is that it has a lot of open space inside, so I could definitely upgrade it as needed, and there's 5 cooling fans! It never gets hot (even after HOURS of playing Valorant) and is pretty quiet. The mouse and keyboard included are okay - I'm sure most pro gamers will want to upgrade, but for now, they work good for me. Coupled with my new 24\" Sceptre Edgeless Curved monitor, it's a perfect match for me.

Anyway, fast forward a week, I'm much more informed and I run into this while looking for a replacement. This PC is amazing, it runs any game I want at max settings even though the components are technically less powerful than the omen which came with the i7-9700k and rtx 2070, although that PC cost $1700 and this one, the SkyTech PC costs only $1000!!! So this runs any game I want perfectly smooth and at a fraction of the cost, it has a total of 5 fans, I originally thought there was only 4 but there are 5, 2 on top, 1 for the exhaust, the CPU is self cooled with it's own fan, and there is one fan you can't really see in the pictures which blows directly towards the graphics card. needless to say this PC does not get hot at all. It stays cool under load which is amazing to me. It came with GeForce Experience already installed which was cool, opened it up and I instantly downloaded the latest drivers for the 1660 SUPER. This PC is just amazing I'm happy I stumbled upon this gem, the RGB lighting is controlled through a button on the top of the case, again this is so amazing to me, The only thing I had to do to this PC since I got it to be fully up to date was update the mobo, update windows and updated the graphics card drivers in GeForce Experience. to update the motherboard it comes with a CD, this PC has no CD drive though, I googled b450 update and I found it easily enough lol.

This skepticism was compounded as I read the reviews AFTER I purchased the product (I purchased the product because my buddy who builds PCs said this was a great deal). I admittedly got very anxious about the product, as well as its delivery to me (I chose 2nd day air shipping).First, what was unfortunate was that my shipping was delayed. As mentioned before, I paid for 2nd day shipping and it did not arrive in two days. I thought about the reviews I read where people had issues with shipping and I thought to myself... damn. Did I just get scammed out of shipping? So I sent an email to customer support and I was say almost instantaneously I received a reply AND refund for my shipping NO QUESTIONS ASKED! Fantastic!!! I was reading how customer support doesn‚Äôt get back to you, isn‚Äôt helpful, etc. So I was very surprised and happy that they got back to me so quickly. That was a huge relief.But wait, there‚Äôs more. I saw a discrepancy between the UPS shipping and Amazon shipping. Amazon said my order had shipped, yet UPS said it hadn‚Äôt received anything yet, only that a label was created. So that confused me... so I contacted customer support AGAIN, and immediately they got back to me and told me that everything on their end was completed and to wait for UPS to scan the item over the weekend (I ordered the PC thru Amazon on Wednesday). So I said ok... that‚Äôs ok.Saturday came, I got an updated saying the item was scanned they UPS, Sunday I got another update saying that my item will be delivered on Monday! Yay!!!So I received the item yesterday, and immediately I saw that the box was punctured a bit. That was a bit disheartening, but I was still optimistic. I opened the box, found a tinier box that had cords in, and began pulling out the item. The PC itself had a huge bag over it, which was pretty cool. So I pulled it out, took off the bag... and boy I was stoked. Everything looked clean physically, and I began to open the PC tempered glass door (which is very high quality IMO), and took out the safety foam from having the hardware move around o n the ride here (which I very much appreciated).Unlike other reviewers on here, I received my correct GPU, SSD, all the goods. I‚Äôm so happy about that! It‚Äôs been running great, (today is T+1 since having the PC) and I‚Äôm very optimistic about the future of the PC. I plan on purchasing a better monitor today and I will see how it all runs. But so far I am very happy and grateful everything came as advertised.

After a couple years, I knew very well I was due for a computer upgrade, as my previous one had been owned for nearly four years and sat on a Radeon RX 580 in our year, 2021.So I went with this one.I'm pretty happy with the presentation and quality of this build. I will admit, I was pretty distracted by the lights it comes with, and I spent a good 15 minutes playing with the colors until satisfied, so that's not at all a bad thing. I'm able to play a lot of modern games at the highest setting and without any framerate drops, and I think that's absolutely fantastic.However, while I'm satisfied with my purchase, getting this thing to work without crashing from a memory management BSOD was obnoxious. These BSODs would occur without warning, and for that it was really frustrating. I'm a college kid, and I only make so much money, so you can imagine how peeved I'd been when this computer would crash at random points throughout my week, despite how much money I'd poured into it. I'm thinking I somehow ended up with a faulty RAM module, because I'd tried every other fix offered to me. Fortunately, I had some money set aside to purchase a new pair of RAM to use instead. These ones fit the PC build much better anyway, and look much nicer than the default pair it came with (OLOy B-21Raider). I'm hoping that this will provide a fix for these blue screens I've been experiencing.I really wanted to give this computer a five-star review, and I'm sure many other people have had great experiences with this prebuild, I think I just ended up having poor luck this time. I think a better quality check was in order, here.TLDR;Despite the issues that I've had, I would absolutely recommend this computer, especially for those who aren't too tech savvy and don't understand what is good hardware and what isn't.

As the old saying goes, buyer beware. When it arrived, it did not have all the internal foam. There was some damage to the ethernet card, and the WiFi antennas were missing. After going through the system and verifying all of the power connections, PCI and RAM I fired it up. It worked great for a couple of hours.Then it began to randomly crash. I started updating all the drivers and Windows to no avail. I managed to do a kernel dump and found that all the crash errors were coming from the Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 video card. I took the card out of the PC and put it into another PC and found that it did the same thing there. After calling Skytech for a few days, and waiting for 4 to 5 hours without and answer or call back, I called Amazon. Amazon offered to either refund the purchase or help me contact Skytech. I opted for the later and after 10 minutes of waiting the Amazon tech said that \"Skytech doesn't open until after 4 pm PST.\" which I found very odd. They said all they could do was refund the purchase. After I checked Skytech's website, I found they are open from 9-5 PST M-F.I tried again the next day and after 2 hours managed to make contact with a rep from Skytech. I explained what I had done and that I had called NVIDIA and Gigabyte (both with less than 30 minutes wait) and they had agreed the graphics card was kaput. The Skytech rep apologized and sent me a text requesting my personal information, invoice, picture of the serial number, and a few other things. I texted it back immediately and was told that they would text me with information to ship the graphics card back to them and once it was received they would send me a replacement. I waited for a couple of days and no information was forthcoming. I texted the number back and had no answer.After doing a cost-benefit analysis, I decided to just purchase a graphics card and bought a PNY RTX 3060 from Best Buy. Now the system works like a dream and plays Sims 4, Civ VI, FS 22, GTA V, Cities: Skylines, CMS 22 and Command Modern Warfare in ways I never knew they could be played.Based on the experience I have had, I would tell you to be prepared that you will either go out of pocket for parts or have to go through the trouble of a refund if yours doesn't work.

If the situation changes, I'll post an update and let you know.P.S.:  Pricing on Skytech's website might be a bit lower than what's listed on Amazon's website, but they don't offer any extended warranty coverage.  And, when you're spending a lot of money for a high tech piece of equipment, you expect it to last for a long time (at least 5 yrs.).  So, the 1 yr. manufacture's warranty just is not enough, therefore I would highly recommend that you get the extended coverage.  It's well worth it.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: 3600 | 3060 | Arch 3Pattern: Desktop", "reviewImages": [], "position": 9}

I probably would have gone with something else if I had know I have to replace the Mediatek card to get Internet running smoothly. Plays Hogwarts Legacy pretty nicely though, so I don't think I will return it. I'll update my review when I have more experience with the device.UPDATE: I did order a replacement Intel WiFi card and removed the faulty Mediatek one. If yours isn't faulty, I wouldn't bother replacing it. Be careful if you do. The Mediatek card's pins were extremely cheap, and broke when I ininstalled it. I had to use a thin needle to clean out the connectors before installing the Intel WiFi card. Everything works great again.

The Camera.  Love that it can be hidden so no chance of someone hacking it and \"spying\".

USB location only in the back.  It'd be nice to have one either in the front or side for the occasional need to plug in a thumb drive for a quick download/upload of a file to travel.

Das sollte die W√§rme dieses passiv gek√ºhlten Ger√§ts gut ableiten.Der Computer ist offensichtlich eher f√ºr den Einsatz in Industrie, Produktion etc. vorgesehen und nicht f√ºr den normalen Schreibtisch-Einsatz -aber dennoch kann man ihn nat√ºrlich auch da n√ºtzen.Der Mini PC verf√ºgt √ºber eine riesige Anzahl an Anschl√ºssen:An der Front gibt es neben einem COM-Port einen SIM-Steckplatz und vier USB 2-Anschl√ºsseDaneben ist rechts der Einschaltknopf mit einer blauen LED-BetriebsanzeigeAn der R√ºckseite befinden sich:-Zwei Antennen-Anschl√ºsse (Gewinde) f√ºr WLAN-Antennen -zwei sind ja im Lieferumfang-3,5‚Äú-Anschluss f√ºr Lautsprecher-3,5‚Äú-Anschluss f√ºr Mikrofon-2 Ethernet-Stecker (Gigabit)-4 USB 3.0-Ports-Ein USB C-Port (TPC)-Ein Display Port (EDP)-Ein HDMI-Port (HD)-Daneben der DC IN-Anschluss f√ºrs externe Netzteil-Unten ganze 5 COM-PortsInsgesamt sehr viele Anschl√ºsse. F√ºr normale Nutzer werden die zahlreichen COM-Ports aber wenig interessant sein, eher f√ºr Spezialanwendungen.Hardware im InnerenDer Mini PC l√§sst sich leicht √ºber 4 Schrauben an der Unterseite √∂ffnen -die Bodenplatte l√§sst sich dann sofort und einfach abnehmen.Schon hat man Zugriff aufs Innenleben: Insgesamt ist das Geh√§use √ºbersichtlich, bei meinem Exemplar war bereits ein 16GB RAM-Modul DDR4 2666 (Marke WEIDIAN) installiert, ein zweiter Steckplatz ist frei.Die Module lassen sich ganz normal austauschen.Die SSD (Marke KingFast) F6M.2 scheint auch einfach austauschbar zu sein.Als Prozessor kommt ein 4-Kern Intel Core i5 8265U zum Einsatz.Au√üerdem gibt es eine integrierte Intel¬ÆUHD 620 Grafik.Aufstellen/Platzieren des Computers:‚Ä®Der Computer verf√ºgt unten √ºber gummierte Standf√º√üe und kann daher nat√ºrlich einfach normal auf einen flachen Untergrund gestellt werden. Ebenso befindet sich an der Unterseite diverse Bohrungen, so dass man den PC an der Wand oder diversen Befestigungen montieren kann, auch eine Befestigungsplatte ist dabei. So kann man den PC auch z.B. an die R√ºckseite eines Monitors mit passenden Gewinden schrauben.An den Seiten der Bodenplatte sind auch vier √ñffnungen, womit man den PC wohl z.b. einfach an Verankerungen oder einh√§ngen oder direkt irgendwo anschrauben k√∂nnte.InbetriebnahmeDer Computer lie√ü sich sofort in betrieb nehmen: Windows 10 Professional war bereits vorinstalliert und aktiviert. Das System war bereits eingerichtet und ein ‚ÄûHistton‚Äú-Account angelegt.Wie vertrauensw√ºrdig das ist, und ob man das System lieber neu installieren will, muss jeder f√ºr sich selbst entscheiden.Auf der mitgelieferten DVD d√ºrften aber nur Treiber sein, ein zus√§tzliches externes DVD-Laufwerk wird zur Nutzung der DVD ben√∂tigt.LeistungDer Computer sollte auf jeden Fall genug Leistung f√ºr Alltags-Aufgaben bieten. Nat√ºrlich ist er wegen dem l√ºfterlosen Design und der Onboard-Grafik f√ºr Spiele, grafikaufwendige Anwendungen etc. ziemlich ungeeignet.F√ºr einen stromsparenden, l√ºfterlosen PC scheinter er aber eine brauchbare Leistung zu bringen.Er startet schnell genug und alle normalen Anwendungen laufen fl√ºssig.K√ºhlung, W√§rmeDas Geh√§use wird an den K√ºhlrippen, speziell auf der linken Seite, sehr hei√üt im Betrieb, dass man ihn gerade noch kurz anfassen kann. Ich hoffe, das K√ºhldesign ist durchdacht, und das sollte so sein, denn ich hatte noch keinen derartig passiv gek√ºhlten PC.Fazit:‚Ä®Ein sehr spezieller Mini PC -f√ºrbestimmte Arbeitsumgebungen und einfachere Aufgaben k√∂nnte er durchaus interessant sein. Ich werde ihn erst mal als Media-PC am Fernseher einsetzen.Wer die vielen COM-Ports wirklich brauchen kann, der hat nat√ºrlich einen klaren Vorteil bei diesem Ger√§t.Alternativ gibt es viele Mini PCs, die etwas aufger√§umter und mit weniger Anschl√ºssen kommen -z.B. Intels Nuk-Serie k√∂nnte f√ºr viele auch interessant sein -man kann sie auch teils selbst ausstatten und anpassen.Wer es optisch hohe Anspr√ºche hat, kann auch einen Apple Mac Mini in Betracht ziehen -der verf√ºgt sogar √ºber deutlich schnellere Prozessoren und die aktuelle Variante (Modell 2018-2020) kann neben Mac OS auch unter Windows genutzt werden. Au√üerdem hat der Mac mini gleich 4 Thunderbolt 2-Ports.Bis jetzt l√§uft der HISTTON Mini PC bei mir allerdings einwandfrei und weitere Erfahrungen reiche ich gegebenenfalls nach.", "isVerified": false, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 13}

They ended up replacing several parts and sending it back to me about a week and a half after I had sent it to them. It worked fine for about 3 and half months... and then.. it wouldnt power on, sent it back again, turns out the power supply died, so I sent it back to have that replaced incase anything else broke. When it came back, it worked but the psu they had used to replace it withs fan was unholy loud. I could hear it 2 rooms away, instead of bothering with their technical support, I spent 200$ on a high quality evga psu to replace it.

I've played other games like Batman Arkham Origins and Path of Exile as well as Apex Legends flawlessly. I create a lot of stuff so it also runs music software like Reaper, illustration like Clip Studio, and 3D modeling like Blender without any issues. Render time in Blender is very fast. Comes with Windows 10 but not Office so if that is important to you, you will have to buy it separately. Great Bluetooth range and connection.Also, I came from a laptop so the extra USB and HDMI ports were a miracle for me. I felt like the product description and pictures could have done a better job explaining what ports and how many for each model so I left my own graphs above. Just remember they are for the RTX3060 model.Overall I'm so happy with this PC and have had 0 problems.

This is the latter. I work in tech and have a very large event every year for 2 weeks which requires a moderate volume of data transfer from SD/USB drives to an external hard drive and cloud. Basically, three times I day I have to sit down and copy an average of 50 mp4 files from an SD card to my Lacie drive and Dropbox. I wanted an additional computer (this one) to tap in remotely to control from my MacBook Pro, which works well but a second computer is necessary if I don't want to give up my MacBook for solely those tasks multiple times a day. I did tons of research to find something that was simple yet fast, ideally an all in one for size. This Acer seemed great on paper so after weeks of comparing, I bought it.Fast forward to DAY ONE of getting this set up at my event. Set up was easy, went smoothly. I set up my USB hub which houses 6 USB drives (this computer and most other only have 2 inputs) and immediately had issues. Only one of the USB slots would be recognized at a time. This hub worked great with my MacBook, so it was obviously the computer. Completely defeated the purpose of purchasing a $100+ hub and 6 SD/USB readers not to mention how much time it would now take to come back 6x for each upload to swap the cards out.I finally had no choice but to only use the one reader, but once past that it was one issue after another. The computer would freeze....it would disconnect from the hard-wired internet...the keyboard would die half sentence with new batteries. The entire experience with this computer was nothing short of an absolute nightmare. I was not asking a lot of a system....simply transfer a few files (no larger than 150mb each) and boom - done. This was way too complex for the computer apparently.It would freeze every time I went to access my remote software....also a complete waste of the $100 software purchased to do this. At 2 am I would have to drive out to our workstation to restart the computer so I could access it from my laptop off-site. Restarting it alone is a 30+ minute process - in fact I click restart 45 min ago, walked and fed my dog and wrote this entire review and it's still on the Acer screen trying to start up. This computer has NO files on it, is less than 14 days old and has no reason so be this sh*tty of a product. I've always been loyal to HP and Mac, and this just reinforces my thoughts on the lack of quality companies like Acer put behind their products.

I have a 1G connection and I still get ALOT of buffering when watching 4K videos on Youtube.  While this is not an unusual thing, the lack of a dedicated graphics card and the extremely slow RAM that the device comes with only make this a more common occurrence.  I've seen videos of similar PCs to this streaming just fine while using Windows 10.  So if that's what you want to buy this for, I would recommend using the included copy of Windows.  But this would definitely need an upgrade to work well in Linux.  I can't imagine gaming with the extremely slow RAM provided, but I'm sure on very low resolutions with esports titles you'd be fine.  I just wouldn't want to do that.  You see the CPU/GPU share the RAM,. so the slower your RAM speed; the worse that everything performs.  I would have really liked to see a much faster max speed for this RAM as even putting another 16GB, in there at this speed probably won't help very much.  But that is the next thing I'm  going to do.  I would wait for a sale and try to spend a little more if you want a computer for gaming.

However, I am super impressed and so thankful that I chose this one! It is sooo worth the money! I started getting into PC gaming not too long ago, mainly playing Minecraft, and much more recently, Valorant. Both games ran like garbage on my old laptop, so I decided to upgrade - and let me tell you that this PC has not missed a BEAT! The only issues I've ever had with Valorant on this PC were due to internal issues with the game itself, not the PC. No lag AT ALL - same goes for Minecraft and a few smaller games I've played. Everything runs absolutely great! I will say I was a little worried when I opened the box up (I was hoping it hadn't gotten damaged during shipping), but it was actually packaged really nicely and came with a nice quick start guide, which was really useful for me, considering I've never set up a gaming PC before. Everything was hooked up properly internally, so it was plug and play after getting everything arranged the way I wanted on my desk, and I instantly loved the RGB lights! They're awesome! You can change the colors just by pressing a button on the top of the PC. I leave mine on the solid rainbow setting most of the time, but there are so many colors you can rotate through! The other nice thing is that it has a lot of open space inside, so I could definitely upgrade it as needed, and there's 5 cooling fans! It never gets hot (even after HOURS of playing Valorant) and is pretty quiet. The mouse and keyboard included are okay - I'm sure most pro gamers will want to upgrade, but for now, they work good for me. Coupled with my new 24\" Sceptre Edgeless Curved monitor, it's a perfect match for me. If I ever need to purchase another PC in the future, I'd definitely buy one again", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: 3600 | 3050Pattern: PC Desktop", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Thojwr4CL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 1}

I'm just trying to make the point that, while I'm not a Power User, I do a lot more than email and browsing the internet.I spent 4-6 hours configuring, loading programs and transferring data, and haven't looked back since.  I am amazed at the power of this unit for my workload, and it is also very quiet. I was expecting to spend between $800 - $1200 to replace my desktop, and since I already had monitors and wireless keyboard/mouse combo, my total outlay was only $300 plus tax for a unit that completely meets my needs.I have not done any research on reliability and I have not needed tech support, so I cannot speak to either of those, but for the cost/performance of this unit, I'll take my chances.

The good:  it is very fast and compact.  The bad:  every time I've done updates that require a restart, I have to unplug it and plug it back in.  Every second time I start it up, I have to unplug it and plug it back in.  I contacted tech support, but they gave me some generic suggestions such as replace the hdmi cable or get a new power supply. I have cleared CMOS using the pinhole and that fixes the problem for one or 2 reboots.  They have also suggested replacing or cleaning the connectors for the RAM and SSD drive I added, but I am reluctant to do that.  I now have it connected to a switchable power strip.  Instead of physically removing the plug, I just switch off the power strip, count to 10, and turn it back on.  That has always worked so far.

I was in the market for a mini PC to use as an emulator box for early to mid 2000's games.

Likewise GameCube runs stable at 1440. No issues so far emulating PSP PSX and N64 in 4K. I paired this with a 12TB external HD for game storage and the setup is working out great so far. I haven't tried any modern games on this and I don't plan on doing so either, I'm sure it could handle them but I would rather play older games that look great on modern hardware than modern games on garbage settings.This is not a knock against the hardware because this little PC is solid and is pretty much exactly what I was looking for, I'm just not a fan of Windows 11 that comes preinstalled. It doesn't seem to be as flexible as previous versions of Windows. I may install windows 10 on it in the future if it continues to bother me but that's getting nit picky.

Was looking for a prebuilt as I just don't want to take time actually researching each piece of hardware and spending my time outside of work doing more work stuff. So a slight increase in cost overall is well worth the convenience. The PC works almost as expected but with some things that just don't make sense for a $700 PC. The glass cover is held down by magnets. If the pull tab that's attached comes off there's no real easy way to the case without something to pop it open with and something about popping open a glass door with a screwdriver doesn't seem like a good idea. Also, it appears that there is supposed to be a magnet both top and bottom of said glass door and one is missing. Only mildly discomforting thinking there's possibly a free-range magnet hanging out somewhere inside a PC where it's not meant to be. One of the top USB ports doesn't work, no power and I haven't bothered to see if there's anyway remedy this but on a brand new PC it shouldn't happen. Peripherals connected to other ports work as expected but not on this one. Not a huge deal with putting the non-power intensive devices on a USB hub which most would have to purchase separately. Purchased this PC aware of some specs and with the understanding that if I did indeed plan to game at all I would likely need at least some sort of video card/GPU upgrade. That being said it was either a 2060 or a 1660 and after reading some comments I went with the 1660 as I didn't want to take chances on needing to upgrade a power supply just yet as well. Now installing graphics cards in the past has always gone one of two ways for any HP, Dell or IBM machine I've done. There's either a tab to pop a latch up to remove the rear device faceplates or individual plates held in place with screws. You then remove the faceplate, insert the new card and either screw the card into place with aforementioned screw or press the latch back into place to secure your new card. Not the situation here, this PC has fully molded faceplates pressed into the casing. They are thin, sharp metal tabs that are lightly perforated so a fair amount of pressure is required to pop them out while you hope not to damage and circuitry below. I installed the card but it would leave anyone with it hanging only by the adapter connection. I had to \"borrow\" a screw from the back of the case otherwise used for the power supply and repurposed it to hold the new card in place. I called the technical support number on the provided contact card that states to call before returning to give them a chance at resolving it. I left a voicemail with my name, the issue and my number Friday afternoon and have yet to hear back now Wednesday evening. Their answering service states hours are M-F 9-5 EST so if you happen to work those same, very common, hours you're apparently on your own or need to take some time off to try and get support for the $700 computer you just purchased. So that leaves me here fighting between wiping the drive, sending it back for a refund and starting from scratch or dealing with the shortcomings that I've found so far and may find more of down the line. Gave it three stars because outside all of that, I did receive a relatively functioning PC.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Color: Black", "reviewImages": [], "position": 7}

Ultimately, this is using laptop internals, packed inside of a computer monitor. The power adapter only has an output of 65 watts, a normal desktop processor alone draws at least that much power and sometimes double. Computers have become powerful enough so that most people don't really need full-fledged desktops like that anymore though. A neat and tidy setup like this is more practical and elegant, so long as you don't need anything too powerful.The first thing I noticed was the quality of the screen, it's as good (if not better) than the average $200 monitor in terms of vibrance and brightness and significantly better than a $700 laptop screen. It's 24 inches in size, with a 1080p resolution, but I think that's enough for general purposes. The speakers are about like what you would get on a TV or monitor at this size, I wouldn't call them 'tinny\" like you might for a cheap tablet or laptop, but they aren't gonna overwhelm you either. They are fine and sound good enough, most people will be happy with the sound quality.One big plus is that this comes with a wireless mouse and keyboard. I think it totally destroys the aesthetic of an all-in-one when you have unnecessary cables hanging off the back of the computer. The keyboard is a low-profile membrane style, it's decent but not great (keep in mind that I use mechanical keyboards, so I have higher than average standards). I think the mouse is a little better than the keyboard.The internals of the computer are really modern, you get a 12th gen Core i3 with 8GB of DDR4 3200MHz and 512GB of fast, NVMe storage. The processor has 2x performance cores with hyperthreading and 4x efficiency cores, giving you a total of 6 cores/eight threads. With a lot of these twelfth generation CPUs, I don't think the e-cores really does anything except make it look good on paper, but with the Core i3, it does actually help lift up the performance a bit more than if it was just a dual core. To make things simple, the CPU is fast and so is the NVMe drive. Everything was really snappy and fluid and responsive while I was testing this computer for a couple weeks and using it as my primary computer.One downside to this design is that it's not very easy to make small upgrades like adding more RAM, another 8GB of it would really help out (if not now, then in a couple of years down the road). It is physically possible to do, but it's harder than adding RAM to a laptop and I don't think I recommend doing it. I may end up doing later and if my opinion changes, then I will update this review.Pros+Bright, vibrant 24-inch screen looks greatModern internals with 12th generation Intel Core i3, good wireless card, and fast SSDGood port selection with five USB ports (1x USB C with 10Gbps, 1x USB A with 10Gbps and 2x with 5Gbps)Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5Windows 11 (although this could be a negative too, some people hate Windows 11 but I think it's better)Wireless mouse and keyboard includedCons-Keyboard feels a little mushy to type on, it's membrane (I think so)Hard to upgrade hardware components, it's difficult to remove the back panel to get to the internal components", "isVerified": false, "variant": "processor_description: i3-1215U / 512GBStyle: Desktop only", "reviewImages": [], "position": 15}

Fortunately, Win11 doesn't really appear to be any more memory-intensive than Win10, and 8GB is enough for running Office 365, or a bunch of browser tabs.  Other Aspire C24s have allowed you to replace the DIMM, but you'll want to check if you're interested.  The NVMe SSD isn't slow, but it doesn't perform up to the level of a fast Gen3 x4 SSD, either.  Built-in wifi is fine, with 802.11ax (2.4/5-only, no 6Ghz), and average performance internal antennas.  The computer manages smooth, full-screen 1080p, which plenty of SFFs struggle with.  The Aspire also has above-average speakers, making this a good dorm-room PC for school during the day, and streaming video at night.Considering that this is essentially just a monitor with a laptop motherboard integrated, it's no wonder that the packaging is excellent.  For just the footprint of a 24\" monitor, you get a full computer.  The included keyboard and mouse continue the theme of maximum space economy, with the keyboard able to stow away on the computer's stand.  The mouse is a compact unit, too.  Speaking of the peripherals, I put the included AAA batteries in the keyboard (2x) and mouse (1x).  Upon noticing that the PC didn't recognize peripherals, I realized that I had to put the USB dongle (in the battery compartment of the mouse) in one of the PC's USB-A ports.  This is annoying because: 1.) the PC only has 5 USB ports, 2.) it's pretty normal to have Bluetooth peripherals, and 3.) this PC HAS Bluetooth!My misgivings about the Acer have to do with some of my prior experiences with all-in-ones.  Generally, they haven't performed all that well, and they tend to be less reliable and expandable than regular PCs.  Though the Acer alleviates my concerns about performance (and to an extent, expandability), high levels of integration do tend to impact longevity.  However, with relatively leisurely workloads, this PC will probably last 5-10 years.  When pushed, the fan in the thermal solution can be heard, but it's never overly loud.So, I LIKE the Acer, but I also got it for a very specific use case.  The Aspire is a reception desk computer at a salon, where it's used for accounting, inventory, appointment management, and payment processing tasks. The tiny footprint is even smaller than if I'd taken a bare monitor and mounted an inexpensive NUC to the back, and is perfect as a point-of-sale computer.  At $650, you can go the monitor + NUC + Bluetooth peripheral route and save a little money, but it won't be anywhere near as neat (a single power cable beats multiple power cables, plus an HDMI cable to manage).

I've never owned a desktop all-in-one unit before, either separate components or laptops so this is a little fresh for me.It came well packed and the stand is easily attached to the screen (no tools required) and it has a little wire management bracket you can slip on. It would have been nice if you had the option to adjust the height, but you can't as far as I can tell. The build quality seems great, no issues there. It comes with Windows 11 which is also new for me as I'm still on Windows 10 with my other PC. The included accessories (keyboard, mouse) are actually decent. They're wireless which is what I prefer.Screen quality is good, with solid color/uniformity. It's a standard 24\" 1080p matte 60Hz IPS panel. No high refresh or HDR or anything like that and it doesn't get super bright if that is what you need. About what you would expect in this price range and a good fit for the specs it has. Operation is fast with the 512 NVMe SSD and 12th gen mobile Intel i3 processor. No GPU is included. Only 8 GBs of RAM which is decent for this price but 16GB is starting to become the standard nowadays. I haven't tried cracking it open yet to see if the RAM can be upgraded and I assume there is no space for an extra storage drive. This unit can't handle any modern games with only Intel graphics or do any serious productivity work so keep that in mind when buying. All the ports work and it has the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards which is a big plus (both perform well). The included speakers aren't very good as you would expect (same with the mic and webcam), I use headphones. There is constant fan noise which can get obnoxious if there is a heavy load. AiO units use laptop hardware from what I've seen so it likely has a cheap laptop fan for cooling and performs as such.Overall I would say this is a solid unit for anyone looking for an All-In-One setup that wants something more substantial than a laptop as far as screen size and connectivity go, even with the minor faults it has.

In all fairness, this is my first time having an AIO, so I don't have much to compare it to by way of comparison, but I will say for the price, aesthetics, functionality, and space-saving utility of not having to have a separate computer tower, this thing is an exceptional buy.Let's begin with the things I most love about it:1) The screen and display are gorgeous. The IPS display gives a wide gamut of rich, deep colors with great viewing angels. At 23 inches there isn't a tremendous amount of backlight bleed, and while the blacks aren't as deep as some alternatives to IPS, the vibrant color scheme more than makes up for it.2) The CPU is superb, and basically does everything you need it to do for most tasks. The thing comes with 6 cores, 2 performance for heavy duty single threaded tasks and 4 efficiency cores for multi-threaded ones. This is more than capable of handling most non-gaming tasks.3) The aesthetics and space-saving is totally wonderful. If the AIOs were priced super high, it wouldn't be worth it, because you could build significantly cheaper. But with the price of computer components so high, if you simply need a well-functioning desktop without all the bulk, get yourself an AIO!My biggest, major \"complaint\" is simply this: you're not going to do anything beyond very basic gaming on this AIO. The integrated graphics are fine for watching videos, browsing the web, playing browser-based games, etc. But for gaming you are missing a dedicated GPU, which makes this NOT ideal for gamers. Beyond that, there are only 8GB of ram in this Acer AIO, and as you can see, even idling, about 4GB of that ram is already used up just from Windows. There isn't a ton of excess RAM, and if I had one major complaint it would be that this should definitely come stocked with 16GB of ram.In short, while I have some minor complaints, I really think this is a great budget AIO with a beautiful display. For the space-conscious folks, you will love it!", "isVerified": false, "variant": "processor_description: i3-1215U / 512GBStyle: Desktop only", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RAI0e6P3L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gJUqd6c2L._SY88.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81kdYyp-mPL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 20}

Included with the computer was a downright plea to contact them if anything was amiss.It took just a few minutes to put the beast together and the thing came to life when I switched on.But there was a problem,; one of the screen displays was wildly off center leaving a two inch black display void on the far left of the screen. I had received the unit that afternoon and by the time I discovered the problem it was slightly after 4 o'clock and their note said don't call after 4 as we won't answer.I was forced to wait another day. Early the next morning I called and a young lady answered the phone, took my account number and we got to work. We quickly narrowed the problem to the monitor and the menu buttons in the front. When pressed they announced that the menu was locked. It took less than ten minutes to discover how to unlock the device (hold the menu button for 30 seconds) amid much laughter and I was on my way.

I originally got this device to use as a dedicated system for a 1080p 32\" touchscreen Alexa and Home automation system.  I wasnt really sure what to expect for speed and quality but it would be fine for that. When I received the computer, it was packaged very nicely and the quality was surprisingly good. After a quick glimpse at that manual, I just decided to plug it in and see what happens. The thing booted right up into Windows 11 Pro and Windows was already activated. Did an initial systems check to make sure RAM, HD, processor was what it was supposed to be. Then I found out that the i5-1135G7 is supposed to be a pretty good chip and actually comparable to my I59600k except with better built in GPU. So I did all the Windows updates and then ran several benchmarks on it to put it under stress. This mini pc breezed through everything. It got a little warm at times and the fan was noticeable, but not overbearing. Kind of like a laptop fan. This unit has really impressed me and its too good to use for my touchscreen system, so I am deciding on replacing one of my other desktops with this instead. All the ports worked without issue. It is a fast system for such a small form factor.TECHNICAL - comes with 16 gig of RAM expandable to 64 gig of SODIMM ddr4, The 512 NVME performed very well and you can easily switch it to a different drive. BTW nvme is a lot faster than any SSD Hard drive. To do any upgrades, you will need a jewelers screwdriver for the tiny 2 screws holding the cover on. I only took the system down to the \"replaceable\" parts and didnt take it all the way apart. I was unable to confirm if the Type C port is actually a Thunderbolt4 port or just a 10Gb/s USB port. The ad says 10Gig, but the user manual states Thunderbolt4. I have included screenshots of the dissassembly as well as the benchmarks. Keep in mind the benchmark percentages mean \"better than xx% of all computers\". When I dropped the resolution down to 1080p, there was a noticeable speed increase across the board. This is probably because the GPU is built on the CPU chip. Of course this unit doesnt have a $500 dedicated video card and there are faster processors, ram or hard drives, but for the price and expandability this is one heck of a fast system out of the box and it truly does compete in many ways with my custom desktop which costs a lot more. This unit even performs better than the numerous laptops I have tested and even some of the newer I7 laptops. I could not find who makes the MB nor could I find this vendors website anywhere. I am super impressed with this unit, the quality and the speed. I may even use this for on site purposes instead of my laptop because of the power and flexibility. The performance on this blows away my Surface Pro4 and it has all the latest Wifi Ax bluetooth 5.2. I connected to my network without any issue.

I has zero issues but one - the Windows Store App wasn't working right (I could use it online through a browser, but not the native app). I got it to work and have been pleased. On my laptop, it took me 1 hour and 10 minutes copying all of my music to a USB key. Copying those same files took 4 minutes on this little PC.

I bought an LG monitor, Amazon speakers and a Logitech bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo and maybe will get the camera at a later date.

I use my computer for reading the news, email, social media, loads of writing, streaming, shopping, and researching everything. Chrome OS suits me: It is snappy and relatively safe from corruption.  I can access MS Office products on the web. I tend to store all my files in \"the cloud,\" which means i can access everything from any device. I see people reviewing this product who did not understand they were buying a Chrome OS system. Because this has a unique design and an unusually large screen for Chrome OS, this All-in-One is over-priced. I ended up buying a version with less storage but at a greatly reduced price pre-holiday -- (I thought it was an error, nope, I got it) -- and returning this one, even though it was relatively well-priced at the time on Amazon. The screen is not anti-glare. I personally will not use the touch-screen function, although it might be very useful for education use, where a teacher, tutor, or parent is working with a student. I will use the portrait mode a lot for reading, writing, shopping, and social media. When used on the horizontal orientation, my unit is not 100% level and that annoys me because I see it -- not everyone would notice. Used on the horizontal, the screen is rather high, to allow it to swivel. (Now I really want a height-adjustible desk.)", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 3}

The first thing I noticed is how incredibly quiet this computer is compared to my previous one. It is almost silent. It is also much more compact, but still has plenty of room for expansion. I'm perfectly happy with the on-board video and I'm using it to drive a 30\" 2560 x 1600 through a DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link adapter and a 20\" monitor directly through an HDMI to DVI cable. Should I choose to use the computer for gaming someday, there's an available expansion slot for a modern video card, unused power connectors ready to go and a 300W power supply built-in. There's also a second expansion slot that's more than adequate for a peripheral card. The 16 GB of RAM it came with only uses one of the two memory slots, so I spent about $45 to add a Crucial 16 GB DIMM (part number CT16G4DFRA32A), bringing the total up to 32 GB. I'm not sure what a previous reviewer was talking about when they wrote that it uses proprietary memory, which couldn't be further from the truth. If I ever need more RAM, the system supports 64 GB. The internal 512 GB SSD is more than adequate for my current needs, but could be replaced easily. There's also a spot to mount a 3.5\" internal hard drive which I'm using with a 2.5\" adapter sled to hold an SSD I had in an old laptop. All the cabling I needed was inside and ready to go. The computer is also lightning fast. Did I mention how quiet and compact it is? I guess I still can't get over that. Having a DVD+RW drive is great for ripping CDs and being able to read and write other legacy media. Windows 11 Pro also seems to be quite stable and I like it a lot more than Windows 10 -- none of those annoying animated tiles on the Start menu that I was always too lazy to hide but never used. The shipping was lightning fast and I had the computer the day after I ordered it. It also came inside of an outer box, adding some extra protection during shipping. To me the only downside was the price -- I was always used to spending well under $750 for my desktop computers, and this was more than that, but it seemed a great value compared to the configurations I could purchase directly from Dell, so I still consider it a win.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Processor Description: Core i7-12700Graphics Description: UHD Graphics 770Style: Standard Form Factor", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

Another problem was that the DVD player could not register half the DVDs from the Bond Series, big disappointment. The reviews for the Bond series mentioned problems.

Especially if you're on a budget and do not know how to build PCs. (Sale price at $700USD plus tax.) I had the unfortunate experience of having to troubleshoot this PC myself. It worked fine out of the box but after a while I experienced issues that came later on due to several issues. (Occurred on 11/20/2022)[Crashing Bios Update from Windows] Problem 1 (Update 11/28/2022)Bios Update 314 has since been removed from their website and optional windows update settings. So, your PC should work out of the box without issues, but I will keep this here in case anyone still ends up having it somehow.(Update 11/23/2022)The Bios Update in Windows Update Settings (This will show up as Asustek Firmware Update). DO NOT INSTALL THIS. It will crash your PC non-stop at random with the BSOD. This Bios Version is: 314.PC Model: G10CE- To fix this head over to the ROG ASUS Support website and find your PC model.- Click on Drivers & Utility and find Bios & Firmware Tab- Download Bios Version 309 For EZ Flash. Put in a USB for later in case of future problems.- Restart PC press F2 and go to Advanced settings. [Tools] ASUS EZ Flash 3 Utility.- Find your USB drive with the EZ Flash Bios file and install it.- If successful, your new Bios Version should be 309. (This can be seen at the top of the screen when you're in Advanced Settings ASUS EZ Flash.)This should fix your PC from crashing.PS. If your PC insists that it wants to update the bios again to 314.Type \"Device Manager\" in the search bar and find \"System Firmware\" and either disable or uninstall the update. I recommend uninstalling it.[CPU Heat & Fan Noise Revving] Problem 2The CPU runs hot at 70-85c at times even when you're not gaming. The PC will randomly rev the fan's speed to compensate for this to which I believe is not healthy for the CPU.- To fix this open Armoury Crate and turn on Manual Mode and set the fan speed to 50-100% instead of 0-100%. This alleviates the CPU temperature from 70-85 to 45-57 while keeping your fans from revving every so often.[Randomly Alt-Tabbing?] Problem 3 (Update 1/14/2022)I wouldn't know what to call this. My PC doesn't necessarily alt-tab, but whenever a folder is open my PC tends to switch to it at random times. Could be a few minutes or hours? It's completely random. I'm not sure what truly causes this.Unknown what causes this. Might be my external hard drive.Personal Fix: Do not have any folders open while gaming or doing any activities.[VR Headset/Oculus Rift S Black Screen/Static Sound/Beep Crashing] Problem 4 (Update 1/14/2022)I'm not sure how other VR Headsets will perform but the Rift S crashes for me after a while of playing at around 5-30 minutes for some reason. The USB ports built into the motherboard seem under-powered because my headset works fine on my other PC. (I have tried all USB ports and it still crashes.)- I fixed this by using a Sabrent USB 3.0 Hub with an A/C power plug and hooked it up to a USB 3.0 slot in the back (Blue USB Port). It stabilized the headset's connection to the PC and now works fine so far.PS. My headset audio was prickly like static without the Sabrent USB 3.0 Hub.Overall, this PC is decent for the price I got it for but I wouldn't recommend it at a higher price with some of the issues that had I had to deal with but you can make your own judgment on that. I would consider buying this PC as a cheap alternative to PC building. It's not as hard as it looks. I believe it will last you a good while until you've saved up enough money for things like:1. CPU Fans. (It runs hot while gaming and could be a little quieter.)- CPU runs hot at 75-85 while gaming (Playing Warhammer 40k: Darktide)- Tower only has 2 fans. One on the CPU and one in the back.2. Power Supply. (Comes with 500W Power Supply. Brand: ACBel P2B 500W.)3. HDD or SSD (You'll definitely need more space than 500GB for gaming or other needs.)- Windows 11 will take about 41GB of memory.- Total GB is 453. So, you'll probably only have 400GB to spare.4. New PC Tower (Tower is relatively small and compact.)Current PC Tower has no room for upgrades or add-ons. You cannot fit a full sized HDD. There is no mount. (Mine is lodged in a hole across from where the power supply is.)Personally, I'm looking into a HYTE Y60 or something similar with a lot of room for improvements and cooling.5. New Motherboard or USB Card or External USB Hub.Motherboard works fine as is, however, the USB ports deliver lackluster power output as far as I know. It cannot power my Oculus Rift S alone. It required a Sabrent 3.0 USB Hub to stabilize the connection.It works for basic needs like Keyboards, Mouses, USB Microphones like Blue Snowball ICE.However, for VR there may be some complications.My old PC which is an Acer Predator G6-710 with GTX 970 worked perfectly fine with VR. Audio never sounded prickly but the microphone tends to be robotic due to how Oculus designed the Rift S. Unfortunately, I do not know how other VR Headsets will fare with this PC, but it is something to consider.[Overall thoughts as a PC in general] 4 Stars: Would buy and troubleshoot again. :skull_emoji:In spite of the issues that this PC has made me troubleshoot. This PC is a 4 star in my book for the price I got it for, however, with the issues that people may or have experienced. I will have to keep this review at 3 stars due to the fact that people may still end up experiencing these issues somewhere down the line as they may end up buying this in the future.It is worth it as an entry level PC despite how bare bones it is. I would recommend considering buying upgrades to start building your own PC with its parts later down the line. It's not as hard as it looks.I bought this PC for a good price with the total being around 800 from Amazon as the seller. It was Black Friday though. So, you can make your own judgment on what price you'd rather have this for.PCs with the same specs have gone for around 1000-1400.Personally, I wouldn't pay more than 1000 for it considering some of the other options you can glance at which could have better cooling, specs, and room for upgradability.I wish that I could've recommended this PC at a 5 star rating with no faults or flaws. However, it does have several flaws which I have listed. Yet, in spite of what I had gone through to make it work. I would consider this PC to be a trooper. It was quite the adventure and challenge to troubleshoot the issues and in the end very rewarding to find the solutions to those faults.Maybe I have Stockholm Syndrome.Either way, I'm not a PC expert. Just a gamer who held a lot of determination and lived off of copium while trying to fix this PC. I did not want to return it at all considering the price was too good to pass up. I believe I will keep this PC for the spare parts in the future where I will end up building my own PC for the first time.I may have experienced problems, but I hope that as you read this you won't have to deal with the same issues. I hope this PC will serve you well should you choose to buy it. I will update this review to reflect further problems that may come around, but I think it'll be okay now.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "processor_description: Intel Core i5-11400Fmemory_size: 16 GBHard Disk Size: 512 GBGraphics Description: RTX 3060", "reviewImages": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vbJ4quKzL._SY88.jpg"], "position": 1}

Individual parts costs too much that is it not worth it anymore for what I do on a PC as I dont PC game anymore these days. My youngest son however plays Roblox and Fornite on PC. My current PC has a i7-4770 cpu!I purchased the G10CE with Intel i5-11400KF, Kingston 16 GB DDR4 3200, and Asus RTX 3060. $739 plus taxes, great price considering what the RTX 3060 goes for. Comes with Windows 11. The SSD is a 512 Gb NVMe WD SN-530 PCI 3.0. The motherboard is a micro-ATX Asus B560 chipset board. 500 W PSU. Didnt check the brand. The case is fairly small for a tower case. It is not greatly ventilated at all. Does have a led RGB strip inside at the top of the case. Has 2 USB 3 ports on the top of the case.The performance of the computer is fine so far. Setup was a breeze. Updated windows, all drivers and software plus the bios of the motherboard. PC boots up in less than 15 secs. The biggest thing that holds this PC back is the motherboard. It is really limited. You cant adjust much of anything in the bios. It has 1 included 92 mm case fan and the cpu fan is also a 92 mm fan. They are SUPER noisy and you cannot adjust the speed of the fans. The case fan header is only 3 pin so you cannot replace it with a 4-pin PWN fan to make it quieter, but you can get another CPU cooler with a bigger 4-pin PWN fan to replace that fan. I found a low profile Cooler Master heatsink and fan unit with a 120 mm PWN fan for $23 on Amazon that should do the trick.Biggest question is can you add another NVMe PCI 3.0 SSD in the other M.2 slot for additional storage space and will the motherboard actually detect it being a B560 chipset. If not, there is some room at the bottom of the case where you can mount a 2.5 inch SSD but there is no way of getting a 3.5 inch HDD to fit in this case.This is great computer for someone on a budget that wants to game at 1080p. You should be able to run max settings on most modern games with the RTX 3060. The other hardware in this PC should not hold you backHowever i am returning it as the aftermarket cpu cooler did not help make it any quieter and i cannot tolerate the fan noise.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "processor_description: Intel Core i5-11400Fmemory_size: 16 GBHard Disk Size: 512 GBGraphics Description: RTX 3060", "reviewImages": [], "position": 2}

Therefore I need to upgrade a number of computers.  This small computer is a reasonable option for most of the application that I use. (word processing and web browsing).  Contrary to what others have said, it came with Windows 11 Pro preinstalled.  I did not need a license code to register it with Microsoft.  I was able to create an offline account.  It took a few downloads, but it is now upgraded to the latest version of Windows 11.For comparison, I recently purchased a mini-tower from a major computer manufacture based in Texas with an i5-10400 processor that costed 2 1/2 times more than the Kamrui.  But for most of tasks I do, there is not a large noticeable difference.  I was doubtful  about the Celeron J4125 processor, but it has sufficient power for word processing and web browsing.  I downloaded a common set of benchmark tests and they confirmed that the CPU performance is significantly  lower that the i5 system.But there are many things I like about this system.  It does have a fan and I do not find it any noisier than other computer systems.  I has 3 USB3.0 ports and I found that at least one of them is powered even when the computer is off, so I can use it for charging my phone.  I used the USB port to create an backup image to a USB 3.0 drive and the write speed was around 600 to 700 MB/sec, which is fine.One pleasant surprise was the performance of the wireless adapter.  I have the computer located close to my 5G wireless router and using Fast.com, the wireless download speed was 300 MB/sec.  That is the same speed I measure when using the 1 GB wired Ethernet adapter.It has two HDMI display ports and one VGA port.  I am using the VGA port with a KVM (Keyboard-Video-Mouse) switch and it works fine.  It also has an internal bay that can hold a 2.5 inch SSD or hard drive.  At some point I will install an old 2.5 inch hard drive and use it to store backup images.I will admit that I was skeptical that I could buy a computer that was adequate to run Windows 11 for around $200 (there was a discount available when I bought it).

I also mostly use the computer for schoolwork and work-related projects, and it is plenty enough for just that.I also did some basic upgrades that some of the reviews suggested including adding another M.2 drive and upgrading to a 16gb 3200 mhz RAM, which really improved its quality. There isn't a screw for the m.2 drive, however, and I had to take it from a spare laptop of mine that no longer works. The installation was easy once I looked up how to on Youtube, and I couldn't be any happier with my decision.

Got it as a secondary pc. I added 32 gigs of 3200 mhz ram, installed a second m.2 drive and added 2 sata drives to it for a total of 10TB of storage. (note: you need to have sata cables to add HDD's, but the connectors are on along the edge of the motherboard sticking out the side towards the bottom side of the pc, took me a minute to find them). The wifi card works fine in it but I swapped mine out for the killer wifi card simply because its better and the killer software gives you nice control on wifi settings. I paired it with an ASUS 32 inch wquhd 144 hz monitor. The keyboard it comes with is kinda small, which is good if you have limited space but I prefer a bigger keyboard so I used a different one. ( I have large hands) I did not use the mouse it comes with, I prefer a thumb trackball mouse but the mouse it comes with is functional and works fine. So far it has performed well. Plays games just fine. It's easy to add upgrades to it. If you buy this pc, in the very minimum i recommend adding at least 1 more 8gb strip of ram to it at 3200 mhz for optimal performance. The 8GB it comes with is not enough for gaming, but this pc is a great starter for the money. If you're on a budget and looking for something affordable, this ACER Nitro is great. I might upgrade the video card at a later date but the Geforce it comes with will run every game currently on the market on medium to high settings, older games can be run at max settings. Overall I am happy with it.Edit: I did upgrade the video card to a geforce 3060 card After having for a few weeks. Now I‚Äôm happier with it.

The unit is super quiet, with just a small momentary fan noise upon boot-up, but after that, it is silent.  The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules work perfectly and connect without a problem.My unit came with a 512GB SSD primary drive and 16GB of RAM.  I added a secondary 2TB 2.5\" HDD and it works perfectly.  Please note that some users have tried to add an SSD instead of an HDD as a secondary drive and that the computer does have issues recognising some SSDs by certain manufacturers (Samsung), so please do your research if you want to use an SSD instead of an HDD as a secondary drive.Power and bootup is lightning fast and it comes with Windows 11 pre-installed.  You can also put Linux on this unit should you choose and you can access the BIOS by pressing the \"del\" key on bootup to access the BIOS settings to install and configure.This is a great little unit at a really good price.

I would caution any one buying this with the intention of using it as a 4K Linux media device.  While it can play 4K video, it definitely struggles with included RAM in streaming it.  I have a 1G connection and I still get ALOT of buffering when watching 4K videos on Youtube.  While this is not an unusual thing, the lack of a dedicated graphics card and the extremely slow RAM that the device comes with only make this a more common occurrence.  I've seen videos of similar PCs to this streaming just fine while using Windows 10.  So if that's what you want to buy this for, I would recommend using the included copy of Windows.  But this would definitely need an upgrade to work well in Linux.  I can't imagine gaming with the extremely slow RAM provided, but I'm sure on very low resolutions with esports titles you'd be fine.  I just wouldn't want to do that.  You see the CPU/GPU share the RAM,. so the slower your RAM speed; the worse that everything performs.  I would have really liked to see a much faster max speed for this RAM as even putting another 16GB, in there at this speed probably won't help very much.  But that is the next thing I'm  going to do.  I would wait for a sale and try to spend a little more if you want a computer for gaming.  Even a cheap laptop with a dedicated GPU would work better than this mini PC.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: MC560(16+512)", "reviewImages": [], "position": 9}

That was until I discovered the interference issues between USB 3.0 and Bluetooth. Turns out, these issues are exacerbated by metal, so you can see how a metal casing wasn't doing me any favors. I pulled out a USB extender and my mouse issues were completely resolved. Still, Bluetooth had a range of only 2-3 feet.

The touch has been flawless and I have already used the touch screen more than I have on my two touchscreen laptops, in ten years.The dongle for the wireless mouse and keyboard is in the mouse, dummy, and also flawless.I love how compact the keyboard is without feeling like a laptop keyboard. My WPM dropped for a few days until I warmed up to it. The silent, soft touch is outstanding!The audio is exceptional, compared to other built-in speakers, but I didn't buy this for sound and haven't listened to enough tracks to be able to offer a real opinion.As for the description, there are several models to choose from, with different RAM, processors, monitor size, etc., so I can see how things can get hairy there. Whether its a $700 or $1400 investment, the item description needs to be spot on and I hope everyone got their purchases squared away; I got exactly what I ordered. I wish I had a Win11Pro option but, I am so happy with the Home version, I may not even upgrade.I have a 2013 Lenovo laptop: 8g i7 still going strong  (lasted longer than dells and hps Ive owned), and I am brand loyal. It was fine until my new gig got me running too many programs simultaneously to run my business with so, new toy and write-off!You'll either like Win11 or you won't but, generally, the older we are, the less we like change so, just bite the bullet. I wasn't a fan of Win8, liked Win10 but, I think Win11 would have been the natural procression from win7.If you are a Mac fan, MS seems to have gone back to their roots and stolen some things from Apple so, the look and feel of Win11 may appeal to you.The placement of the USB ports are convenient, or not. Some on the back and some on the side of the monitor. I added a USB expansion for things I disconnect often.The camera is pull up/push down and adds 2\" to the height of the monitor. A small but important detail, with all the video conferencing today and, Windows Hello facial recognition.

The keyboard and mouse are a wireless joke.....they're such poor quality that I'm getting a wireless Trackball mouse and a USB connect keyboard as most wireless ones I found are simply flimsy.  If an extended warranty had been offered, this would be a solid 4 stars imo.  If it held at the sale Price and you could get the extended warranty then I would give it  5 stars as getting a new mouse and keyboard would be worth it.  It takes a minimum of 4 hours to get all the excess garbage off of it and have a solid firewall and anti-virus to supplement Defender.  I found that right off you have little control of the system until you wrench it away.  It comes with Win 10 though it says 11.  Right after turning on it's set to download and upgrade to 11, BUT when you check the system it says it's still 10.  That being said, it does give you the option of reverting to 10.  Confused yet?  One thing....If you try to introduce or download another anti-virus or firewall , McCaffee will designate them as harmful and not allow it.  So you either remove that crap and download what you want with Windows Security running or download it on another system, transfer it to a USB drive, turn OFF your modem, and then go at it.  Imo, the screen is great.  I can barely hear one fan running and it sounds like a fan that need to be replaced already.  So I recommend a stand alone monitoring program to warn you of over heating etc so you don't burn it up.  I am NOT going to recommend or endorse any particular software.  Do your own due diligence and pick what you are satisfied with.  It's also very quick to set up and start up.  It is one of the very best packaging I've ever seen.  The way Amazon packed it the factory packed box was terrible, but the great job done by Lenovo kept it from harm.  I say this from years of professional packing experience and ridiculously low claims on my part.

That review noted the GK3 Plus would not hit the claimed CPU turbo speed of 3.4GHz, never getting higher than 2.7GHz. The seller responded to the review and offered a replacement PC, which I agreed to check out. The purpose of re-reviewing the Kamrui GK3 Plus was to determine whether my original experience was typical, and if so, whether there is any significant effect on usability or real-world performance at 2.7GHz vs 3.4GHz.The test PC‚Äôs were the Kamrui GK3 Plus, an N95 model of slightly different design, and an N6005 ‚ÄúSilver Pentium‚Äù mini (3.3GHz turbo). All PCs contain 16GB of DRAM, although it is implemented as dual-channel for the N6005, while the N95 minis use single-channel.  For testing, I used CPU-Z‚Äôs ‚ÄúBench CPU‚Äù feature and Cinebench, as well as several programs that track minimum, current, and maximum speeds and temperatures of processor cores.RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†N95 GK3 Plus¬†¬†--¬†¬†N95 PC #2¬†¬†--¬†¬†N6005 PC #3---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Base clock:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.7GHz¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.7GHz¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.0GHzObserved fastest clock¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.7GHz¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.4GHz¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.3GHzCinebench, single core¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†725¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†903¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†667Cinebench, four cores¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2543¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2672¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2410CPU-Z Bench, single core¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†305¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†367¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†305CPU-Z Bench, four cores¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1180¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1185¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1187Max Temp & Power (¬∞C - W)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†78¬∞ - 11W¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†65¬∞ - 7W¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†60¬∞ - 18WTEST SCORES SUGGEST:a. The ability of PC #2 to hit 3.4GHz provides some advantage in single-core mode, but any advantage becomes virtually insignificant for all three PC's when four cores are running. The number of operating cores and the speed of individual cores are set automatically as the PC's run.b. The higher base clock speed and dual-channel memory of the N6005 PC were not enough to take a lead over the other PC‚Äôs, but did provide comparable performance.c. The higher peak CPU temperature in the GK3 Plus can be managed by making sure the PC is not resting on a surface that restricts airflow. The majority of cooling air enters and exists through vents on the underside of the case. Adding taller stick-on feet to the bottom of the case can help. Note these temperatures occurred only under heavy processor load. The GK3 Plus temperature normally hovers around 50¬∞C or less.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:The GK3 Plus uses easily replaceable laptop style memory that can be accessed by removing the 2.5\" SDD basket. Processor specs indicate 16GB is the maximum. Some report installing a 32GB memory module, while other comments state adding more than 16GB might not be worth the additional cost.Per videos, it is possible to get at the SSD and swap it out as well, but the SSD is hidden on the bottom side of the circuit board and requires a more involved disassembly and care not to break wires going to the case. The SSD is probably an M.2 SATA device, not NVMe, but the socket in the N5105 version of this PC appears to be NVMe. For more storage, it is easier to install a 1GB or 2GB 2.5\" SSD in the top of the PC and use it for data and program installations.CONCLUSION:I spent several hours comparing PC's. In the end, I noticed no obvious difference in overall performance, or in response while web browsing. In a ‚Äúblind test,‚Äù it would be difficult to tell which PC I might be using. Real-world performance is not hampered in any noticeable way by the ability to run at 2.7GHz vs 3.4GHz, especially since the other N95 PC spends most of its time at 2.7GHz.About 90% of GK3 Plus reviews rate the PC at 4 or 5 stars, which indicates the GK3 Plus is successfully meeting the expectations and needs of purchasers. Based on my most recent experiences, I‚Äôve added a star to my rating of the Kamrui GK3 Plus. The various coupon incentives offered by Amazon can make the GK3 Plus a very attractive choice.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Size: Intel Alder Lake-N95/16GB RAM 512GB SSD", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

When I couldn't find a low-profile desktop in my budget and with the desired specs I turned to mini PCs.  The Ace ARM5 ticked off all my boxes:- great chipset with dedicated graphics- tons of expandability- small form factor- good selection of I/O (including Display Port & USB-C)- decent thermals- interesting design (I love it) and RGB lights- GREAT PRICE!!!While my Intel i7 laptop is faster, the difference is barely noticeable in everyday tasks and web browsing.  This is the only mini PC I found with a combination of Display Port + USB-C + USB-A 3 ports.  Expanding the memory from 16 to 32 GB and adding an additional 1T SSD was super easy due to the magnetic side panel (and only brought my total costs to $600 USD).As for gaming...playing E-sport titles (like CSGO, Fortnite, etc.) is great.  I've transitioned to playing AAA titles on my console, so don't need (or want) to play them on this machine.  However, I was surprised how great this little PC handled City Skylines.  I loaded up my largest save (over 500K population) and the ARM5 navigated around and rendered everything without a hitch.  The fan did kick on, but it's so quiet you'll never hear it over your game sounds.In terms of \"cons\" the power selector is a bit of a gimmick.  You'll probably leave in one mode and forget about it.  Also, I wish the RGB light patterns you set were remembered when you have to shut down/restart (I eventually just left it as the \"rainbow\" default).  Finally...you'll either love or hate the design.  I think it's pretty interesting, but have seen other reviews that can't stomach it.  The tented form factor helps keep it cool. and the small footprint (about the same space as a Roku or Fire TV remote) is great for anyone with limited desk spaceAll-in-all this is a great machine at an even better price, and I would highly recommend purchasing it!!!", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: Ryzen 5 5600U/16G RAM 512G ROM", "reviewImages": [], "position": 14}

Removing the top half of the box you can see just how small these PCs are. I have never owned a PC of this size. I pulled out my portable bluetooth mouse and placed it on top for reference how small this! In the box you get the mini PC, a VESA mount, mounting screws, power brick, instruction manual, and HDMI cable.¬†I plan on mounting mine to the back of my monitor so I opened up the instructions to take a look. Instructions are very clear. There was a section for how to install the vesa mount plate with detailed pictures. Very professional looking. Install the plate with the provided screws on the monitor. Install two mounting screws on the bottom of the mini PC.¬†The CPU in this is the coffee lake 8259U with 4 cores and 8 threads. You can get 8 or 16 GB SODIMM RAM, which means you can always upgrade later up to maximum of 32GB. You can also pick between a 256 or 512 GB nvme SSD storage. There is also room for a 2.5 inch SSD/HDD which I think I‚Äôll add later.¬†For IO you get a front facing USB type A and type C port and a headphone jack. On the side you have a standard SD card slot. On the back is a 19V barrel jack for power, a mini display port, 1000Mb ethernet, two USB type A and one USB type c that also supports display out, and lastly a HDMI port.It has windows 11 pre-installed.

{"productAsin": "B0BQVM2XL6", "ratingScore": 5, "reviewTitle": "Endlich ein leiser Mini-PC mit einer guten Performance f√ºr das Homeoffice", "reviewUrl": null, "reviewReaction": "92 people found this helpful", "reviewedIn": "Reviewed in Germany on April 3, 2022", "date": "2022-04-03", "country": "Germany", "countryCode": null, "reviewDescription": "Nachdem ich einige Jahre lang einen gro√üen und lauten Desktop Tower-PC arbeite, war ich auf der Suche nach einem kleinen und leisen Mini PC, bei dem ich keinerlei Abstriche machen muss. Der neue Mini IT8 von GEEKOM ist schon einige Zeit unter anderem in den USA auf dem Markt und wurde dort von den Tech-Experten von ZDNet f√ºr dessen gute Erweiterbarkeit, die vielen Schnittstellen und den leisen L√ºfter hoch gelobt.Da der Mini-PC nun auch in Deutschland erh√§ltlich ist, war f√ºr mich klar, dass ich den kleinen Mini unbedingt ausprobieren muss - ob dieser mein bisheriges PC-System vollst√§ndig ersetzen kann!? Ich m√∂chte Euch gerne meine Einsch√§tzung und Erfahrungen mit dem Mini IT8 weitergeben.--- Leiser L√ºfter trotz angemessener PerformanceMini PC‚Äôs gibt es viele auf dem Markt, von unperformant und g√ºnstig, bis hin zu hochgez√ºchteten und ultra-teuren Power Horse PC‚Äôs, die eigentlich in einem Mini-PC Formfaktor nur selten gut aufgehoben sind. Der Mini IT8 von GEEKOM befindet sich irgendwo in der golden Mitte hiervon. Die Architektur der verbauten Intel Quad-Code CPU i5-8259U der 8. Generation ist zwar nicht mehr taufrisch, liefert aber einen optimalen Kompromiss aus Leistung, Kosten und geringer Abw√§rme: Der verbaute L√ºfter ist unter normalen Arbeitsbedingungen kaum wahrnehmbar und surrt nur leise vor sich hin, was f√ºr mich eines der wichtigsten Kriterien √ºberhaupt darstellt, da der Mini-PC in unmittelbarer N√§hre auf dem Schreibtisch steht.--- SSD- und RAM-Speicher sind flexibel erweiterbarNeben einem leisen L√ºfter werden noch weitere wichtige Anforderungen an einen guten Mini PC erf√ºllt: der Mini IT8 hat eine Menge Schnittstellen und l√§sst sich zudem flexibel erweitern. Die verbaute Kingston SSD (2280 M.2 Formfaktor) kann mit nur wenigen Handgriffen gegen ein SSD-Modell mit maximal 1 TB ausgetauscht werden, falls die verbauten 256 GB irgendwann mal knapp werden sollten. Ein weiterer 2,5-Zoll SATA Anschluss bietet sogar Platz f√ºr eine zus√§tzliche SATA SSD bis maximal 2 TB.Der DDR4 RAM-Speicher, √ºbrigens ebenfalls Markenspeicher von Kingston, ist mit 16 GB bereits √ºppig dimensioniert, selbst unter Windows 11 Pro bietet dieses noch einige Reserven f√ºr die Zukunft. Doch auch der RAM-Speicher lie√üe sich sp√§ter mit einem zus√§tzlichen SO-DIMM-Riegel auf maximal 32 GB erweitern. √ñffnen l√§sst sich das Geh√§use hierzu mit leicht zug√§nglichen 4 Schrauben, was auch technischen Laien gut gelingen d√ºrfte.--- Es gibt viele und vor allem moderne SchnittstellenbuchsenNeben der flexiblen Erweiterbarkeit der internen Komponenten √ºberzeugt der GEEKOM Mini PC aber insbesondere auch durch seine diversen Schnittstellenbuchsen. √úber die drei verbauten USB-Buchsen lassen sich externe Festplatten, Speichersticks oder ein DVD-Brenner anschlie√üen. Diese sind dank der Unterst√ºtzung des aktuellsten USB 3.2 Gen 2 Standards mit maximal 10 Gbit/s auch f√ºr die Zukunft ausreichend schnell. Dar√ºber hinaus gibt es zwei moderne USB-C Buchsen, eine hiervon ist DisplayPort-f√§hig, sodass sich hieran beispielsweise ein aktueller 4K-Monitor betreiben l√§sst.--- Mehrere 4K-Monitore lassen sich anschlie√üenDer Mini PC unterst√ºtzt offiziell bis zu vier 4K UHD-Displays bei einer Bildwiederholrate von 60Hz, was in dieser Anzahl vermutlich niemand aussch√∂pfen d√ºrfte. Ich selber verwende einen 28-Zoll HUAWEI MateView mit 4K-Aufl√∂sung √ºber HDMI am GEEKOM Mini IT8. Dieser wird problemlos erkannt und sch√∂pft die volle UHD-Aufl√∂sung aus. Dank einer beiliegenden VESA Mount-Halterung l√§sst sich der kleine PC auch problemlos hinter einem Display montieren, sodass der Mini-PC keinen weiteren Platz auf dem Schreibtisch ben√∂tigt. Neben HDMI 2.0 gibt es noch einen Mini-DisplayPort und den genannten USB-C Anschluss f√ºr die Verbindung von weiteren Displays.--- √úbliche Schnittstellen entsprechen dem aktuellen StandardEine LAN-Buchse f√ºr die Netzwerkverkabelung ist ebenso vorhanden, wie ein SD-Kartenleser und ein 3,5mm Klinkenanschluss f√ºr Boxen oder Kopfh√∂rer. WLAN wird nach dem WiFi 5 Standard (ehemals als 802.11ac bezeichnet) unterst√ºtzt, was einen Durchsatz von maximal 1,3 GBit/s erlaubt. Das aktuelle WiFi 6 kann der kleine Mini-PC leider nicht, allerdings sind moderne WiFi 6 f√§hige Router noch recht selten und derzeit kaum verbreitet, sodass ich hierin keinen echten Nachteil sehe. Das Bluetooth-Protokoll l√§sst sich ebenfalls verwenden, beispielsweise zur Anbindung von kabellosen Tastaturen, M√§usen oder Lautsprechern.--- Einsch√§tzung der Leistungsf√§higkeit: ein Arbeitstier f√ºr das HomeofficeDie Intel Quad-Core CPU des kleinen GEEKOM Mini IT8 ist mit seinen maximal 8 Threads im Hyper-Threading Modus ordentlich flink unterwegs. Das vorinstallierte Windows 11 Pro reagiert fl√ºssig, auch im Betrieb mit mehreren parallelen Programmen, wie beispielsweise Office-Apps und Google Chrome mit diversen offnen Tabs und gleichzeitigem Abspielen eines YouTube-Videos gibt es keine f√ºhlbaren Einschr√§nkungen. Unter normalen Homeoffice-Bedingungen konnte ich den Mini-PC bislang nicht an seine Grenzen bringen - dieser d√ºrfte, meiner subjektiven Einsch√§tzung nach, f√ºr mich √ºber ausreichend Leistungsreserven f√ºr die kommenden Jahre verf√ºgen.Da die CPU auch den modernen H.265/HEVC Video-Codec in der Hardware decodieren kann, eignet der der Mini-PC zudem hervorragend als Video-Player im Wohnzimmer, beispielsweise f√ºr Netflix oder Amazon Prime Video - der L√ºfter bleibt hierbei angenehm leise. Die verbaute interne Grafikeinheit Intel Iris Plus Graphics 655 leistet zwar problemlos den 4K-Monitorbetrieb, ist den Anforderungen von modernen Grafik-intensiven Spielen aber nicht gewachsen. Hardcode-Gamer werden also nicht gl√ºcklich mit dem Mini-PC und sollten daher auch weiterhin lieber zu einem Tower-PC mit einer dedizierten Grafikkarte greifen. F√ºr ein paar Casual Games zwischendurch reicht die Grafik-Performance des GEEKOM Mini IT8 aber allemal.--- Viel Kunststoff aber dennoch recht hochwertig verarbeitetAbseits der technischen Spezifikationen ist f√ºr mich die allgemeine Verarbeitungsqualit√§t und das Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis bei der Auswahl des richtigen Mini-PC‚Äôs wichtig gewesen. Das Geh√§use des GEEKOM Mini IT8 ist weitestgehend aus einem schwarzem Kunststoff hergestellt. Lediglich der Unterboden und zwei seitliche K√ºhlgitter sind aus Metall. Hier h√§tte es meiner Meinung nach durchaus etwas ‚Äûmehr‚Äú sein d√ºrfen, beispielsweise ein Aluminium-anstatt des Kunstoff-Deckels.Allerdings ist die Qualit√§t der Verarbeitung und der verwendeten Materialien absolut in Ordnung und der Mini-PC liegt mit einem Gewicht von etwa 570g auch durchaus wertig in der Hand. Es finden sich keinerlei ungew√∂hnliche Spaltma√üe und es knatscht und quietscht auch nichts unter Druck. Der Mini-PC √ºberzeugt mich eher als pragmatisches Arbeitstier und weniger mit einem h√ºbschen Design. Aber auch das ist Geschmacksache und bei der Wahl eines Mini-PC nicht unbedingt entscheidend.--- Was mir gut gef√§llt+ Der geringe Formfaktor mit einer geringen Grundfl√§che von ca. 11,5 x 12,0cm (L√§nge x Breite) und einer H√∂he von lediglich 5,0cm.+ Der integrierte L√ºfter ist angenehm leise und im normalen Homeoffice-Betrieb kaum wahrnehmbar.+ Die gebotene System-Performance ist ein guter Kompromiss aus ausreichender Leistung, zu angemessenen Kosten bei nur geringer Abw√§rme.+ Es handelt sich bei der verbauten SSD und dem RAM-Speicher um hochwertigen Markenspeicher von Kingston.+ Der Mini-PC kann zuk√ºnftig flexibel erweitert werden mit mehr RAM, einer gr√∂√üeren SSD oder einer zus√§tzlichen 2,5-Zoll Festplatte.+ Die verbauten Schnittstellenbuchsen sind vielseitig und entsprechen den aktuellsten technischen Standards.+ Das vorinstallierte Windows 11 Pro ist h√∂herwertiger als die Home Edition, welche die Konkurrenz h√§ufig beilegt.+ Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t des gesamten Systems ist auf einem angemessenen, hohen Niveau.--- Wo ich noch Potential sehe- Das Geh√§use d√ºrfte gern aus etwas mehr Aluminium bestehen.- Anstatt des verwendeten Rundsteckers vom Netzteil w√§re die Stromversorgung √ºber USB-C w√ºnschenswert gewesen.--- Mein pers√∂nliches FazitDie in Deutschland bislang unbekannte Marke GEEKOM hat mit ihrem Mini IT8 vieles richtig gemacht. Die Arbeit mit dem kleinen PC macht Spa√ü, wenn man bedenkt, was alles in der geringen Grundfl√§che des Handteller-gro√üen Ger√§tes steckt. Der Mini-PC l√∂st meinen bisherigen gro√üen Tower-PC ab und ich habe bislang nichts vermisst. Falls der SSD-Speicherplatz irgendwann nicht mehr ausreichen sollte, dann kann ich diesen mit wenigen Handgriffen selber erweitern oder einfach eine zus√§tzliche 2,5-Zoll SSD einbauen.Der leise L√ºfter war, neben der guten Gesamtperformance und der flexiblen Erweiterbarkeit f√ºr mich das entscheidende Kaufkriterium. Ich kann daher nur jedem empfehlen, dem kleinen Mini PC eine Chance zu geben - f√ºr mich ist es jedenfalls die richtige Entscheidung gewesen.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 16}

Weitere Windows-Updates werden nach dem ersten Start im Hintergrund noch heruntergeladen. Alternativ funktioniert auch Linux wunderbar (getestet mit Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon).Die Bootzeiten mit Windows aber auch Linux sind fix, in wenigen Sekunden ist der Rechner einsatzbereit.Im Leerlauf verbraucht der PC nur ca. 8-10 Watt (gemessen mit einer smarten WLAN Steckdose), beim Browsen oder bei normalen Officearbeiten ca. 15-30 Watt, unter Volllast (Benchmarks, Enconding o.√Ñ.) auch mal 50 Watt. Alles im Rahmen. Auch die Lautst√§rke empfinde ich als vollkommen OK. Im Leerlauf ist der L√ºfter aus, bei etwas mehr Last h√∂rt man den L√ºfter nur leise.Als CPU kommt der Intel Core i5-8259U mit bis zu 4 x 3,80 GHz zum Einsatz. Die Grafikkarte Iris Plus 655 ist integriert. Der CPU-Typ ist schon ein paar Jahre auf dem Markt, aber f√ºr den Anwendungsbereich v√∂llig ausreichend.Die 16 GB RAM sind f√ºr das normale Arbeiten mehr als genug (verbaut ist ein DIMM, ein weiterer DIMM kann nachger√ºstet werden, sodass insgesamt bis zu 32 GB RAM m√∂glich sind). Auch die verbaute 256 GB M.2 SSD von Kingston ist flott. Die SSD kann sehr einfach gegen eine Gr√∂√üere ersetzt werden, zus√§tzlich l√§sst sich eine 2,5\" SSD parallel einbauen.√ñffnen l√§sst sich der PC mit 4 Schrauben - man sollte etwas aufpassen beim Aufmachen, um nicht das SATA-Kabel mit zuviel Schwung abzureissen.Treiber f√ºr Windows 10/11 findet man im Support-Bereich auf der Geekom Webseite - dort gibt es auch Windows zum Download, wenn man den PC in den Werkszustand zur√ºcksetzen muss.Im AMI BIOS k√∂nnen die √ºblichen Einstellungen vorgenommen werden.Zusammengefasst l√§sst sich sagen, dass der kleine \"Kraftzwerg‚Äú schnell und leise ist, wenig Strom verbraucht, erweiterbar ist und alle wichtigen Schnittstellen mitbringt. Die Windows Pro Version (statt nur die abgespeckte Home-Edition) rundet das positive Bild ab.Sch√∂n w√§re noch gewesen, wenn der Mini PC Wifi-6 unterst√ºtzen w√ºrde und vielleicht noch einen USB-Anschluss mehr h√§tte. Das Design ist schlicht, aber letztlich Geschmacksache.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 17}

Will probably crush any emulation you throw at it.One thing I love? Zero bloatware. I booted Windows and found absolutely nothing else on this PC. That alone was wonderful. Runs Windows great. Pro tip...I'm using a 720p display, which gives me great frame rates on games. It can almost certainly handle 1080p but you may be more limited on playable titles and settings. Also awesome I can add a SATA drive and upgrade RAM. If this PC had thunderbolt or an extra PCIE4 M.2 slot for using an external graphics card, it would be hands down the best mini PC for the price.Couldn't be happier.

I wanted upgradability, quiet, powerful, compact, and simple. I quickly got into the $1500 range and out of my price range. I wanted a computer that I can easily set up on my couch and take down as needed.This computer has exceeded my expectations in every way. It is quiet, very powerful, had a clean install of Windows 11 Pro. From the moment I plugged it in, it has run flawlessly. It was easy to set up, everything worked as it should.Because of the pricing of this PC, I was able to put together a setup that is much more custom, rather than being stuck with what a laptop offers. I bought a nice portable monitor to my liking, I bought a small mechanical keyboard, a very good gaming mouse and saved a lot of money in the process.Being a techie, I looked into all the components they used. It is obvious to me that they put a lot of effort into building a quality computer. And they took time to design a nice well engineered case to hold it all and make it perform and cool. I was worried that they were just trying to build a cheap PC and sell it for cheap and that is not at all the case. I am impressed, which is not easy to do.The only flaw I can find, which I already knew going in, was the lack of video out on the USB-C. It is a limitation of the motherboard and they may just not of had that option.This PC is very fast, games perfect, runs cool. I highly recommend this setup with the 5600H processor. The only software glitch which you will need to address is downloading and installing the latest AMD adrenaline drivers and interface to get the most out of gaming and graphics.Good Job Beelink! Keep up the good work, you deserve it on this one.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 10}

As such, I will be attempting to run this headless, and don't care about graphics quality.  Mine had a serial port instead of a third display port, unlike what other reviewers received, but that's fine with me.There is a M.2 (A+E) slot for a WiFi adapter, but that was empty and the two antenna plugs were just dangling under the SSD.  However, they included a USB WiFi adapter in the package, so I guess that counts as meeting specs.  Also, it frees up that slot for a M.2-to-SATA adapter so I can rig up an external eSATA drive bay.  Yay!  There is also an empty 2280 NVMe slot below the 2.5\" SSD.The biggest scare was the unit's condition when I first opened the box.  There was a screw missing from the drive bay, and another (different size) screw loose and rattling inside the chassis when I unboxed it and slid the top off.  I suspect the loose screw was from a M.2 card they removed; they should have just tightened it down so it wouldn't rattle free, as powering it up like that was likely to short something.Also, there was a loose piece of plastic that seems to be part of the fan duct that normally goes between the cooler fins and the rear of the case.  The rest of that duct was simply missing, so I'm worried about over-heating as the warm air recirculates rather than being expelled.  That part doesn't seem to be available new or used anywhere, so I'm hoping I can get by with some Kapton tape or 3D print something that fits.In addition, the back panel was slightly bent and some of the CPU cooler fins were damaged, but nothing that couldn't be straightened or would prevent it from working; it is used, after all.  I think the people doing the refurbishment just don't understand how to use the packaging to secure the unit when it's shipped, as that seems to be a common complaint.So, after a little additional refurbishment, I put it back together, plugged it in, and it did boot up just fine.I don't recommend this for people who aren't comfortable opening up a PC case and replacing internals.  However, for someone looking for a media PC or small x86 server to tinker with, it may just fit the bill.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Hard Disk Size: 512 GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 1}

I believe the two systems came from different companies, but Amazon's product system is flawed so only one review can be entered and may or may not apply to the actual vendor.Refurbished: one just barely met the criteria stated by Amazon. The other most definitely did not. It had a damaged USB port and was dirty and front cover scuffed, easily visible from across the room, not just arm's length. I was able to carefully repair the USB port, wipe down the box, and don't care about the scuff. Just worth noting. Cleary this company has poor quality control or people that do not under stand the criteria or care. Who knows. I did not want the hassle of returning the item if I could avoid it. Not everyone buying one of these systems will be in that position, however, so these things need to work properly upon delivery.One system arrived with a very low quality mouse and keyboard which was unexpected since this was not listed in the description. The other did not. Neither system arrived with any sort of wifi, as expected based on the description. Both systems had the 16 Gb of RAM, 512 Gb SATA SSB (different brand in each)  and the i5-7500T processor. There's room in each system for an M.2 drive as well as M.2 wifi slot. Each system also had the option slot populated with Displayport so there are three (3) DP ports, no HDMI. Good to know in case you require different cables or adapters for your display device.Internally, watch for the following. I had examples of each:- screws missing from brackets, possibly rolling around inside the chassis which could cause a short, or the wrong size screw for the purpose- incorrect and missing drive caddy retention device- loose and broken plastics brackets for the CPU fan shroud- M.2 screws may or may not be present, so have spares if you need themSeriously, these are NOT refurbished by any reasonable definition. Lower expectations accordingly, be prepared to either fix things yourself or spend time going back and forth with the vendor-of-the-day getting one that actually meets specifications.The other issue is Amazon itself. I purchased a specific model from a specific vendor that was advertised as Prime and had a specific delivery date. A day after the order was placed the delivery changed and it was now going to be 4 days later, and was not listed as Prime. Such tactics I have seen before at Amazon. Feels like bait and switch. Very irritating.In the end, these do serve the intended purpose for me. These will be hit or miss. Casual users may wish to carefully consider if they're in a position to deal with potential issues.I'd (carefully and reluctantly) purchase again when the price is sufficiently low.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Hard Disk Size: 512 GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 3}

A refurbished low cost micro-sized PC seemed like the perfect solution.First the packaging:It came in a box the length of the keyboard, thick enough to also include in it the mouse, power supply, and micro pc.  It appears to be a box just put together by folding over a large piece of cardboard, and it fell apart as soon as I opened one end to remove the contents.  Strike one, but ok this isn't a real big deal.Ok fine, they cut corners in getting the packaging together to keep costs down.I check the power supply and it is not an HP power supply, but some off-brand third party unit. I figure as long as it works, it shouldn't be an issue.I connect the PC up to a monitor via displayport cable, plug in the AC adapter, plug in the mouse and keyboard, and try powering it on.  Nothing happens.  I recheck all the connections and they seem good.  But still the PC won't power up.  I plug in the AC adapter to a different AC on the power strip and try again... still no go.  Bad PC?  Bad power supply? Incompatible power supply?  Strike two... maybe they will ship me a replacement power supply, and I can use my laptop AC adapter in the mean time.Since I also have an HP laptop, and the plug in the back appears to have the same connector, I try my HP AC Adapter from my laptop to try and power it on.  Voila!  It powers up!  The included power supply appears to be incompatible with this HP micro PC.So I try configuring Windows as it goes through the Windows setup screens.  I'm noticing that the monitor will flicker intermittently, perhaps once  every 5-10 seconds or so.  Maybe this will go away once I complete the Windows setup and update drivers, and perhaps use another DisplayPort, as this unit has 3 DisplayPorts.I completed the setup and updated all drivers and firmware (it was already the latest firmware from HP).  I tried all 3 DIsplayPorts and a different DispayPort cable, but the flickering continued.  This appears to be a sign of issues with the micro PC itself.  Strike three!There are just too many issues with this system.  The refurbisher seems to have no QC in place to check for such issues.This was sent back for a refund.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Hard Disk Size: 512 GB", "reviewImages": [], "position": 8}

The first was DOA (bad GPU) and the second, while it worked well enough, had poor cooling out of the gate, limited expandability after looking closer at the case and motherboard, and a ton of bloatware on it. Frustrated, I waited a couple weeks and then resumed my computer search. That's when I found the Hellfire II and, after looking over its parts and the existing reviews, decided to give it a try. Obviously, I tried to keep my expectations low, but I figured the components of the Hellfire II themselves I could not source for less money (not without sniping for deals over time) so I thought it was worth a try.I've only had it a week and a half, but it has performed wonderfully in that time. My primary use for it is streaming video, some minor productivity (word processing and web-browsing,) and gaming. I am not a hardcore gamer by any means, but the RTX3060Ti plays the couple games I enjoy most (Killing Floor 2, Hunt: Showdown, Cyberpunk 2077 for example) at highest settings with high and stable frames on a 4K monitor. The particular one I got (if anyone is interested) is an MSI RTX3060Ti. All in all it pretty much crushed my expectations in a positive way.Other comments: I am very happy with the cooling situation, which as I mentioned previously was a concern of mine with these little cases with hardly fans in them. The AMD processor keeps up with everything I do easily; I haven't even come close to taxing it, and it also stays very, very cool with the water-cooling system (which itself rates very well if you look it up.) 16GB of RAM is plenty for me as well. It's cheap enough to upgrade to 32, but as with the processor comments I haven't even come close to needing all 16GB. Haven't even used the 1TB HDD it came with yet and have no plans to, but it's a nice-to-have if I ever do. The PSU I got was 650W, which, between itself and the Cooler Master chassis, allows for a moderate amount of expandability options - I expect to get a lot of life out of this going forward.I am very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone trying to get a budget gaming build (or do anything graphical processing oriented) with some modest to good parts and options to grow in the future.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "Style: Hellfire II_3060_57G", "reviewImages": [], "position": 3}

I'm somewhat PC illiterate and haven't owned one in over 12 years...even then, I had an Acer Laptop! I definitely got the nice plug and play experience and everything started up very smoothly and nicely :) I have no complaints about the setup process and Windows 10 is glorious. There are a couple things to note, though, if you are starting out.1. My RGB fans didn't work right away. When I turned on the tower, I expected it to light up. I didn't mind opening up the side panel to look around at the motherboard - but the motherboard doesn't have an RGB connector at all. A cord on the opposite side panel wasn't fully locked into place when it arrived. Not a huge deal for me though, but it would've been nice to see it light up the first time. I emailed support about this and they got back to me right away :)2. I 'saved' some money by getting this build, however, I soon realized I would need storage as it filled up quickly. Just keep in mind if you get the 500gb SSD you'll be needing some extra storage. I went with an internal HD Toshiba X300 (4TB).I've had this PC for a week and I don't have any complaints at all. It's beautifully built, works just fine (comes with all the extra cords needed to add more storage), I don't play a lot of FPS games - mostly MMORPGs, RPGs, and The Sims, so I wouldn't say I'm someone who needs the best of the best, but this does a pretty damn good job of making the experience worthwhile. My next upgrade is for the ram/memory but I can wait on it a bit :) also... don't forget to hook up your HDMI to the better graphics card!

It's a fairly weak PC for gaming, but can be upgraded. They don't all come with the same parts either. Some will have nicer RAM sticks and RGB fans while others will come with super cheap sticks of RAM and black fans that don't work with RGB. It's a toss up as to what you'll actually get. So there's that. Some are slightly nicer than others, yet the price is the same. I've seen some come with more expensive video cards and some with generic video cards. If you like RPGs like me, that 500GB SSD is going to fill up VERY fast, so you might want to upgrade that as well. I have single games that are 64GB in size. The mouse is nice as is the rainbow keyboard that they come with. The mouse is corded, not cordless, so that's a plus if you hate paying for batteries. I play games like Dragon Quest XI S: Definitive Edition, Trials of Mana, Tales of Zestiria, Tales of Berseria, etc and depending on which game I'm playing, I'll have to reduce the resolution to 720 in order to get smooth fps. Some will run smoothly in 1080, but that's rare. This is not a powerhouse PC. The cheapest one is very entry level and won't blow anyone away.

But I see why there is no upgrade option as this is how amazon bought the unit and can't make any changes after it was delivered to their warehouse.  It's not a setup where Amazon send the request for this unit and Dell sends it to Amazon after the purchase.  This would be a better method for customers but may not be the best format for Amazon.  I will not be buying computers from Amazon because of this, i.e., the lacking of an upgrade capability to add in a basic thing like an hdmi.

Not wanting to build I have been looking but never talked myself into another.  I was getting closer and then I saw this.  I love the simplicity of the front, its just a beautiful clean design that makes on look twice.  The start button and and ports line vertically down the right side are neat and in easy reach, ready to work.  Being a photographer, top of the list was the graphic processor so after researching before taking this offer this  AMD Ryzen 7 5700G Processor was rated as the the best integrated processor, that all I needed to kick me into taking this.Last year I made up a short video slideshow to make a somewhat non scientific benchmark to test the time each of my devices to render it in my video editor.  Its just a simple mix of twenty five images with music.  My former, still good, PC did it in 55 seconds,  my mid range gaming laptop I got back in 2019 did it in on minute 2 seconds.  Now for this processor it rendered in just twenty five (25) seconds (tenth of seconds rounded), that sold it for me.  On the other specs I was going to give it four stars but bumped that up simply for that reason, its the best I have ever had.Now for the rest I do wish it had another M2 slot for another drive, 512 is not enough. I have a 1Tb 2.5 inch SSD of images over half full.  I saw inside there are sata connections to will instal that drive so I'm going to instal that soon.  I do wish it had dual HDMI ports on the back as I do like to work with two screens when editing, I'm working of finding a way do do that which would pretty fill my bucket list for a computer.In the end this is a great, better than expected, desktop tower that for the most part be would all that one would need.UPDATE  I have installed my 1Tb SSD and works perfectly.  I do most of my work on two screens but had a hard time finding a way to extend the screens as this model does not have the capability.  After four cables and three devices all but one sent back I found a way and works great.  I love this computer is plenty fast for my use.

Out of the box this had near 0 wifi signal when in the same room as my 802.11AX router.  Did a driver update on the card (had to manually get it from another computer and place it on USB due to poor connection) and bam, full bars.Next had to do a driver update on the bluetooth as well, wouldn't stay connected to the bluetooth amp (using a Fosi Amp to power two Polk t15s in the kitchen cabinets)BUY RAM!  4 gig is a HUGE bottle neck.  I grabbed 16 gig (over kill, 8 is enough for our purpose) of Gskill DDR4.  The computer than ran faster than some laptops with much faster processors.Lastly, make sure you buy some 1 ft USB and HDMI cables if you plan on doing a VESA mounted touchscreen build.Boot is fast, coming with Win 10 Pro is why I bought this one.  The 240G SSD is decently quick.as stated 4 gig of ram is woefully inadequate for any use past booting it up and shutting it down.  It would choke opening a single window of Firefox or chrome.  With 16 gig it runs multiple windows and tabs with Amazon Prime music running in the background no problem.My use was a kitchen PC.  I run only Prime music, firefox for recipe's and basic research and the Lorex camera app.We are using a planer touch screen and Windows is set to tablet mode.  No keyboard or mouse at all.  works like a big tablet, but FAR faster and cheaper, (if you can find a 23 inch tablet)I am planning on getting another mini PC now to replace my work computer, but I would never recommend gaming on something this small.  I can imagine it over heating under those loads.  Maybe Angry Birds would be ok!  Not serious hard core games though.  Division 2 chokes my i5 desktop with a 2060, can't imagine it even running on the Minix with its Pentium silver and integrated graphics.WARNING: When disassembling for upgrade, be very careful of the wifi antenna (cables).  They are very think and taped to the case.  do not just lift the motherboard out!!! Also be careful of them on reassembly, they want to fall into the way of the screw hole below the SSD to the left of the RAM slots.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 2}

This support was a little slow as they are not US based and would respond to my emails outside business hours here in the states. So, one email a day took a while for them to come to the same conclusion I had before contacting them. The SSD had failed and needed replaced. After a few weeks of the back and forth a new drive was shipped to me and then I had to load the OS to the device to get it going again. Not a problem for me as a full time IT professional. May be a problem for you if you aren't one. The device is working again and seems to be performing as it originally did.Make sure that you do not use the US support contact information provided on Minix's web site if you have trouble. Use their Hong Kong support as the US support does not exist and your emails will go unanswered.***Original Review***We purchased 27 of these for a business use. Most have been working just fine. We have had an SSD fail in one of these devices, so far, during the 1 year warranty period. We have emailed the support address the manufacturer provides on their website. We have received no response in over two weeks to multiple emails.Because of this, I cannot recommend purchasing these if you think you might need to rely on the warranty. If you only need these to work during the Amazon return period, then it may be worth the risk for you.Also, keep in mind that these units with the extra RAM you will have to physically open the device and install the RAM yourself.

I took the 4gb of RAM from one and added it to the other, and then replaced the missing RAM in the first unit with an 8gb chip. I was worried about being able to run the Windows and Office software and also stream video with just 4gb. So this was preventative. We got the version of the minix with built-in 240GB ssd. The thing is cute, takes about 30sec to open (4 screws after you peel off the little rubber feet) and snaps in place in the included plastic VESA  holder that screws to the back of the Benq screen we bought. Something to keep in mind: this is compatible for a 60hz screen, which is fine for us. Also, if you want to clamp it to a monitor, and simultaneously use the monitor‚Äôs stand, make sure the monitor‚Äôs stand bracket doesn‚Äôt use or get in the way of the vesa mount!This thing fires up right away and works just as you‚Äôd expect right out of the box. It even came with an hdmi cable so they didn‚Äôt cheap out. We needed to buy a compact USB extension cable (with multiple ports) because it only comes with 3, but the unit is tiny and lightweight and so far is working really well for us at a great price. If things progress this way over a year or so, we will plunge in and get a bunch more for our office. We don‚Äôt put an insane load on our computers, but when I have gone cheap with an HP with a lame processor and 4gb of RAM, it was unbearably slow. The minix seems much better especially with the SSD. In the future, if I can‚Äôt get one with the SSD built in, I have now seen what the inside of this thing looks like and adding an off-the-shelf SSD would be a snap and I wouldn‚Äôt think twice about it.", "isVerified": true, "variant": "", "reviewImages": [], "position": 4}

That's all these PC's will do. They will access these web pages, open attached PDF's or short instructional videos, and allow the user to input data back into the software. These will not be running Excel, processing large video files, running multiple programs at once, gaming, or doing any 3D design work.For our purposes, when paired with a touch screen monitor, these appear to be a really good solution. We're working on placing them into Windows 10's Kiosk mode to lock them into the application we want. We did upgrade the RAM as 4 GB shared with OS and GPU (in the CPU) did not leave all that much for running multiple browser windows. We felt that 8 GB would give us some cushion in that area. The devices seem responsive and easy to set up/configure as they run a full version of Win 10 Pro.One downside I am seeing is that build quality may be suspect. After adding RAM, I had next to zero wireless reception. I re-opened the case to see if something had come loose. Visually, it did not appear so and swapping RAM sticks does not impact the wireless card. However, after removing the M.2 SSD, I noted that the main antenna connection (grey wire in my case) was not fully seated. This was also under what looked like hot glue. I removed the glue and antenna connectors and tried to re-seat them. The secondary (black) cable seated with no issues, but the grey one kept popping off. I inspected it and found the connector had been all mangled and required quite a bit of re-work to get it connected. If you have WiFi reception issues, you may want to check these connections.That and conflicting information as to the actual warranty of these devices is the reason for my 3 out of 5 stars.
