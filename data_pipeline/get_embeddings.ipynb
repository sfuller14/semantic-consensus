      "Awesome Laptop. I purchased this for college online. I will be traveling and not have access to my desktop. I was surprised by how fast it started, and everything is smooth when transitioning between applications or documents. It comes with Windows already installed.  It only took about 10 minutes for all the updates.  After logging in to my OneDrive account, everything was linked, so there was no need to pull any files off my older devices to transfer to my new laptop.  This makes my assignments easy to edit or turn in no matter where I am.  Highly recommended.  It is light weight, relatively thin yet sturdy, big screen and full keyboard (with the numbers off to the right) I am very delighted with my purchace.\n",
